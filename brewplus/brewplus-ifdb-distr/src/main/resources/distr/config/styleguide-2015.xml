      <revision number="1">2015</revision>
      <section>
        <paragraph>In order to reduce the size of style descriptions, we use some basic shorthand or jargon to represent more complex thoughts, and we also omit some items that should only be noted in exception circumstances. Some terminology may have different meanings in certain parts of the world, so we define our usages to avoid confusion. We also identify certain characteristics that are assumed not to be present in all beer styles so we don’t have to repeat those restrictions in every style.</paragraph>

        <sectiontitle>Basic Categorization</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>The most general categorization of beer styles by yeast type is a modern craft brewing phenomenon. American brewers and most other craft brewers call beers <em>ales</em> if they use top-fermenting (ale) yeast and <em>lagers</em>  if they use bottom-fermenting (lager) yeast. Most categorization systems will allow for a third classification, often called spontaneously-fermented because of the method; however, <em>wild</em> is perhaps a more widely-used modern craft beer term for these beers fermented with bacteria or non-saccharomyces yeast. The term <em>wild</em> in this context does not imply spontaneous fermentation; most are directly inoculated with the desired fermentation strains.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In Germany and other old world brewing centers, the terminology most typically used to differentiate beers is to refer to them as <em>top-fermenting</em> or <em>bottom-fermenting</em>. Germans think of ale as a type of English beer, and lager as a method of conditioning beer. So Germans would typically speak of Kölsch as a top-fermenting lager beer, not an ale.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>English brewers, particularly when dealing in a historical context, might separate ales from porters and stouts as types of beer (although in the next breath, saying there is no difference between porters and stouts). When dealing in even more historical contexts, they might go even further to describe ale as distinct from beer in that beer was hopped (or more highly hopped) than ale. These historical notes are important for understanding old recipes and writings, but have little relevance today in the common usages of terms describing beer.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>These guidelines attempt to use the modern craft beer definitions of <em>ale</em>, <em>lager</em>, and <em>wild</em> as the major groupings of beer styles, but will mention how they might be described in local or regional contexts, if possible.</paragraph>

        <sectiontitle>Common Attributes of All Beer Styles</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>The attributes discussed in this section are assumed to be present in every beer style description unless otherwise noted. It is not necessary to repeat all these characteristics for every style description. <em>Do not assume that since a characteristic (such as diacetyl) isn’t mentioned in a style description that somehow it is allowable.</em></paragraph>
        <paragraph><span class="underlined">Unless explicitly noted in an individual style description</span>, all beer styles are assumed to be cleanly fermented and free from technical faults, including acetaldehyde, astringency, chlorophenols, diacetyl, DMS, fusel alcohol, and phenolics. All beer styles are assumed to be free of packaging and handling faults, including oxidation, light-struck, sour, and musty characteristics.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In mouthfeel, all beers are assumed to be free from astringency, and not be creamy or have any other palate sensations unless otherwise noted. Beers with an alcohol level of 6% or less are assumed to not have the flavor or warming nature of alcohol, unless otherwise noted. Higher-alcohol beers that have a noticeable alcohol presence should not be harsh, hot, solventy, or burning. The alcohol character if noted, should be clean and not have fusel alcohols.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Lagers tend to be smooth, clean, and free of esters, but may have slight yeast-derived sulfur notes that are often fleeting. Styles made with a large amount of Pilsner malt may have low DMS notes; this is not a fault, but it is also not required unless otherwise noted. In both cases, the small amounts of sulfur and/or DMS should not be taken as meaning that prominent quantities are somehow desirable – they’re not. Just be aware that the use of some traditional ingredients often leave small sensory indications of their presence that might be considered faults in other contexts; that is perfectly acceptable, although not required.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unless otherwise noted, assume all lagers to not have any fruitiness (esters). Ales tend to be less smooth than lagers, so unless otherwise noted, assume all ales may have some esters (not required, but not a fault).</paragraph>

        <sectiontitle>Glossary</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>Some terminology used in the style guidelines may be unfamiliar to some readers. Rather than include a complete dictionary, we have highlighted a few terms that either may not be well understood, or that imply specific meanings within the guidelines. Sometimes ingredient names are used as a shorthand for the character they provide to beer. When judges use these terms, they don’t necessarily imply that those specific ingredients have been used, just that the perceived characteristics match those commonly provided by the mentioned ingredients.</paragraph>

          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>American hops</definitionterm>
            <definition>modern American brewing hops from the craft beer era, typically having citrusy, resiny, evergreen, or similar characteristics. More modern hops can add even more unusual and experimental characteristics, such as stone fruit, berry, and melon.</definition>

            <definitionterm>Old World hops</definitionterm>
            <definition>traditional European brewing hops, including Saazer-type hops, British brewing hops, and those other varieties from continental Europe. Typically described as floral, spicy, herbal, or earthy. Generally less intense than many New World hops.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>New World hops</definitionterm>
            <definition>American hops, along with those from Australia and New Zealand, and other non-Old World locations. Can have all the attributes of classic American hops, as well as tropical fruit, stone fruit, white grape, and other interesting aromatics.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Saazer-type hops</definitionterm>
            <definition>often called noble hops, traditionally among the finest continental European brewing hops. Often having a lightly floral, spicy, or herbal character; rarely brash and aggressive, typically more subtle and elegant in nature.</definition>

        <definitionlist>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Munich malt</definitionterm>
            <definition>can provide a bready, richly malty quality that enhances the malt backbone of a beer without adding residual sweetness, although some can confuse maltiness with sweetness. Darker Munich malts can add a deeply toasted malt quality similar to toasted bread crusts.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Vienna malt</definitionterm>
            <definition>can provide a bready-toasty malt presence, but don’t expect the toasted notes to be extreme – they’re more like untoasted bread crusts than toasted bread.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Pilsner or Pils malt</definitionterm>
            <definition>continental Pilsner malt is quite distinctive, and has a slightly sweet, lightly grainy character with a soft, slightly toasty, honey-like quality. Higher in DMS precursors than other malts, its use can sometimes result in a low corny DMS flavor.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Maillard products</definitionterm>
            <definition>a class of compounds produced from complex interactions between sugars and amino acids at high temperatures, resulting in brown colors and rich, malty, sometimes even somewhat meaty compounds. In previous versions of the guidelines, known as melanoidins, which are a subset of Maillard products responsible for red-brown colors (and, according to Kunze, are “aroma-intensive”). In some brewing literature, melanoidin and Maillard product are used interchangeably. The chemistry and flavor characterization is not well understood, so brewers and judges should avoid excessively pedantic discussions around these points. The takeaway is that we mean the richly malty flavors, and need some kind of convenient shorthand to discuss them. Maillard is pronounced, roughly, as “my-YARD.”</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Biscuity</definitionterm>
            <definition>dry, toasted grain, flour, or dough flavor reminiscent of English digestive biscuits; in brewing, a flavor commonly associated with Biscuit malt and some traditional English malts.</definition>

        <sectiontitle>Yeast or Fermentation Terms</sectiontitle>
        <definitionlist>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Clean fermentation profile</definitionterm>
            <definition>the quality of having very low to no yeast-derived fermentation by-products in the finished beer, typically implying that there are no esters, diacetyl, acetaldehyde, or similar components, except if specifically mentioned. A shorthand for saying that the long list of possible fermentation by-products are not present in significant or appreciable quantities (barely perceived trace quantities at the threshold of perception are typically acceptable, nonetheless).</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Pome fruit</definitionterm>
            <definition>apple, pear, quince. The botanical classification contains other fruit, but these are the common ones we mean.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Stone fruit</definitionterm>
            <definition>fleshy fruit with a single pit (or stone), such as cherry, plum, peach, apricot, mango, etc.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Brett</definitionterm>
            <definition>shorthand term for <em>Brettanomyces</em>, an attenuative genus of yeast that often is used to produce fruity or funky complex flavors (leather, sweat, funk, etc.) in fermented beverages. Literally means “British fungus” and is often associated with qualities produced during barrel aging. Common species used in brewing include <em>B. bruxellensis</em> and <em>B. anomalous</em>, although they are sometimes knownby other names; several strains exist with very different profiles (as with <em>S.cerevisiae</em>). May be used as a primary fermentation or secondary fermentation strain.</definition>

          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Adjunct quality</definitionterm>
            <definition>a characteristic of beer aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel that reflects the use of higher percentages of non-malt fermentables. Can present as a corny character, a lighter body than an all-malt product, or a generally thinner-tasting beer. Does not necessarily imply the use of any specific adjunct.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>DMS</definitionterm>
            <definition>Dimethyl Sulfide, which can take on a wide range of perceptual characteristics. Most are inappropriate in any style of beer; however, a light cooked corn quality may be apparent in beers with high levels of Pilsner malt. When the guidelines state that any levels of DMS are appropriate, it is this light cooked corn flavor, not other cooked vegetable characteristics or other DMS flavors.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Rustic</definitionterm>
            <definition>coarse, hearty, robust character reminiscent of older, traditional ingredients; perhaps less refined as a general sensory experience.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Elegant</definitionterm>
            <definition>smooth, tasteful, refined, pleasant character suggestive of high quality ingredients handled with care; lacking rough edges, sharp flavors, and palate-attacking sensations.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Funky</definitionterm>
            <definition>A positive or negative term, depending on the context. If expected or desirable, can often take on a barnyard, wet hay, slightly earthy, horse blanket, or farmyard character. If too intense, unexpected, or undesirable, can take the form of silage, fecal, baby diaper, or horse stall qualities.</definition>

            <definitionterm>Belgian Lace (Lacing)</definitionterm>
            <definition>a characteristic and persistent latticework pattern of foam left on the inside of the glass as a beer is consumed. The look is reminiscent of fine lacework from Brussels or Belgium, and is a desirable indicator of beer quality in Belgium.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Legs</definitionterm>
            <definition>a pattern that a beverage leaves on the inside of a glass after a portion has been consumed. The term refers to the droplets that slowly fall in streams from beverage residue on the side of the glass. Not an indication of quality, but can indicate a higher alcohol, sugar, or glycerol content.</definition>

        <sectiontitle>Color Reference</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>Note that SRM is a measure of beer color density more than hue/tint. Keep this in mind when attempting to use only SRM numbers when describing beers. Within these Guidelines, beer color descriptors generally follow this mapping to SRM values:</paragraph>

        <sectiontitle>Style Organization</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>The beer styles described in the guidelines have been categorized to assist with running homebrew competitions. Categories (the major groupings of styles) are artificial constructs that represent a collection of individual sub-categories (beer styles) that may or may not have any historical, geographic, or traditional relationship with each other. Do not infer that membership in a style category somehow relates beer styles with each other. The only reason why they are grouped together is to assist with managing the scale and complexity of competitions. The names given to the groupings are for competition purposes only, and may not be used in any broader contexts in the beer and brewing industries.</paragraph>
        <paragraph><strong>Competitions do not have to judge each style category separately</strong>; they may be combined, split, or otherwise reorganized for competition purposes. Competition organizers are free to combine style sub-categories into their own competition categories. As long as each submitted beer is judged against the identified sub-category (style), any logical grouping is permitted.</paragraph>

      <section>
        <sectiontitle>Style Tag Reference</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>To assist with regrouping styles for other purposes, we have added informational tags to each style. These tags indicate certain attributes of the beer that may be used for grouping purposes. The ‘meaning’ column explains the general intent of the tag, but is not meant to be rigorous, formal definition. In no way do the tags supersede the actual descriptions of the style.</paragraph>

      <notes>Questa categoria comprende le birre americane di tutti i giorni molto amate dal pubblico. Ci sono ale e lager, tipicamente non complesse, che hanno un gusto liscio e gradito al grande pubblico. Le ale tendono ad avere caratteristiche tipo lager o sono prodotte per attirare i bevitori di lager di massa come birre “tanto per cambiare”. Le birre per consumo di massa ma con un richiamo od origine più internazionale sono descritte nella categoria International Lager.</notes>

        <impression>lager molto gasata con corpo leggerissimo senza gusto proprio e da bere molto fredda. Molto rinfrescante e dissetante.</impression>
        <aroma>Da scarso a nessun aroma di malto, benché possa anche avere un sentore di cereale, di dolce o di mais (se presente). Aroma da luppolo assente o leggero, con presenza di profumi floreali o di speziati. È desiderabile una fermentazione pulita ma è accettabile un basso livello di caratterizzazione del lievito (fruttato di mela). Pure accettabile è un basso livello di DMS.</aroma>
        <appearance>Da paglierino a giallo pallido. Schiuma bianca poco persistente. Molto limpida.</appearance>
        <flavor>Relativamente neutra al palato con un finale fresco e secco e sapore appena percettibile di cereale o mais che può essere percepito come dolce per la bassa luppolatura. Il luppolo varia da nullo a bassi livelli con caratteristiche floreali, speziate o erbacee (anche se di rado è abbastanza forte da essere percepito). L’amaro è molto basso. L’equilibrio generale varia da leggermente maltato a leggermente amaro che in genere si equilibrano. Gli alti livelli di carbonazione possono accentuare la freschezza secca del retrogusto. Carattere pulito da lager.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo molto leggero, talvolta acquoso. Molto carbonata con sensazioni di frizzantezza sulla lingua.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Disegnate per incontrare il gusto della grande maggioranza della gente. I sapori forti sono un errore.</comments>
        <history>La Coors produsse per un breve periodo una Light Lager nei primi anni ’40. La versione moderna di questo stile fu prodotta dalla Rheingold nel 1967 per i bevitori attenti alla dieta. Solo nel 1973 divenne molto popolare dopo che la Miller Brewing Co. comprò la ricetta e fece una forte campagna pubblicitaria rivolta agli sportivi con lo slogan “tastes great, less filling” (ha più gusto e riempie meno). Le birre di questo genere divennero le più vendute in USA negli anni ’90.</history>
        <ingredients>Orzo distico o esastico con alte percentuali (fino al 40%) di riso o mais come aggiunte. Enzimi aggiunti possono alleggerire ulteriormente il corpo e diminuire la quantità di carboidrati.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Rispetto ad una American Lager ha un corpo più leggero, meno alcol e meno calorie. Meno carattere luppolato e amaro di una Leichtbier.</comparison>

        <comments>I gusti forti sono un errore. Negli USA questo stile di birra è il preferito da chi non beve birre artigianali. Può essere venduta come Pilsner al di fuori dell’Europa ma non si deve confonderla con gli esempi tradizionali.</comments>
        <history>Anche se gli emigrati tedeschi in America producono lager tradizionale di espirazione Pilsner fin da metà 1800, lo stile lager americano moderno fu fortemente influenzato dal Proibizionismo e dalla seconda guerra mondiale. I birrifici sopravvissuti si consolidarono, espansero la distribuzione e promossero attivamente uno stile che si rivolgeva alla gran massa della popolazione. Alla fine fu lo stile dominante per molti decenni dando poi origine a concorrenti internazionali che hanno sviluppato birre blande per il mercato di massa con l’aiuto di forti campagne pubblicitarie.</history>

        <impression>Birra pulita, semplice, ben attenuata, gustosa per americani senza troppe esigenze. Beverina e rinfrescante ma con più carattere delle tipiche lager americane.</impression>
        <aroma>Deboli note di malto con aroma dolce che ricorda il mais. Sono ammessi bassi livelli di DMS ma non sono richiesti. Aroma da luppolo da nullo a basso con note floreali, speziate o erbacee tra le più comuni. Globalmente un aroma sottile dove non dominano né il luppolo né il malto. Si può percepire una debole presenza di esteri fruttati ma non sono richiesti.</aroma>
        <appearance>Da paglierino chiaro a dorato moderato anche se di solito è tendente al chiaro. Schiuma da bassa a media con carbonazione da media ad alta. Ritenzione della schiuma adeguata. Birra chiara e brillante.</appearance>
        <flavor>Amaro da basso a medio-basso. Maltosità e dolcezza da basse a moderate che variano a seconda della OG e della attenuazione. Di solito è ben attenuata. Non prevalgono né i malti né i luppoli. È presente un gusto da mais da basso a moderato come pure un basso DMS (opzionale). Il finale varia da poco secco a debolmente dolce. Pochi esteri fruttati sono opzionali. Il gusto di luppolo varia da basso a medio-basso (si può usare qualsiasi varietà ma tipicamente si impiegano luppoli floreali, speziati o erbacei).</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Sensazione di leggero e fresco anche se il corpo può arrivare a livelli medi. Morbida in bocca con attenuazione medio-alta, gli esempi con livelli di attenuazione maggiore conferiscono una qualità dissetante. Carbonazione alta.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Le Cream Ale prima del Proibizionismo erano un po’ più alcoliche e più luppolate (anche con dry hopping) e più amare (con IBU 25-30 e oltre). Queste versioni dovrebbero essere incluse nella categoria Birre Storiche. Gran parte delle birre in commercio ora hanno una OG tra 1.050 e 1.053 e la IBU di rado supera i 20.</comments>
        <history>Ale spumeggiante o da consumo quotidiano che esisteva nel 1800 ed è sopravvissuta al Proibizionismo. Da considerarsi una versione ale della lager americana prodotta dai produttori di ale per competere con i birrifici in Canada, della costa atlantica e del Midwest. In origine si chiamava ale da consumo quotidiano, alcuni produttori usavano ceppi di lieviti per lager (e ancora alcuni li usano) ma non erano storicamente mescolati a ceppi ale. Molti esempi subiscono il kräusening per ottenere una buona carbonazione. La maturazione a freddo non è tradizionale anche se alcuni produttori talvolta la fanno.</history>
        <ingredients>Si usano normalmente ingredienti americani: malto esastico o una miscela di esastico e distico. Si può aggiungere fino al 20% di mais in fiocchi nell’ammostamento e fino al 20% di glucosio o altri zuccheri nella bollitura. Preferibile usare acqua leggera. Si può usare qualsiasi varietà di luppolo per amaro e finale.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Simile alla Standard American Lager, ma con più carattere.</comparison>

        <impression>Birre di frumento rinfrescanti che possono avere più carattere luppolato e meno da lievito delle cugine tedesche. La fermentazione ben fatta permette l’equilibrio tra il gusto di pane e l’amaro da luppolatura piuttosto che il gusto di lievito.</impression>
        <aroma>Carattere di cereale, di pane o impasto per pane da basso a moderato. Accettabile una dolcezza di malto da leggera a moderata. Gli esteri possono essere da moderati ad assenti per quanto debbano riflettere ceppi di lieviti americani abbastanza neutri, il sentore di banana non è appropriato. L’aroma del luppolo è da basso a moderato con toni agrumati, speziati, floreali o fruttati. Nessun fenolico di chiodo di garofano.</aroma>
        <appearance>Di solito da giallo chiaro a dorato. La limpidezza può variare da brillante a torbida con somiglianza alle Weizen tedesche. Schiuma bianca, generosa e persistente.</appearance>
        <flavor>Gusto di cereale, di pane o impasto per pane da basso a moderato che può persistere anche nel finale. Può avere una dolcezza di malto oppure un finale secco. Amaro da basso a moderato che talvolta perdura nel finale. L’equilibrio di solito è bilanciato ma può anche essere leggermente amara. Luppolatura da bassa a moderata (agrumato, speziato, floreale o fruttato). Gli esteri possono essere da assenti a moderati ma non devono includere la banana. Niente fenoli di chiodi di garofano. Può avere un finale leggermente fresco.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo da medio-leggero a medio. Carbonazione da medio-alta ad alta. Opzionale una leggera cremosità; le birre di frumento danno una impressione di soffice morbidezza.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Esistono molte variazioni: da birre alquanto dolci e facili da bere a quelle secche con luppolatura aggressiva e forte gusto di frumento. Le birre americane con la segale dovrebbero invece essere inserite nella categoria Specialty Alternative Fermentables Beer (Birre specialità con fermentabili alternativi).</comments>
        <history>Birra artigianale Americana adattata dalla Weizen tedesca ma con lieviti più puliti e più luppolata. Fu ampiamente pubblicizzata dalla Widmer (Oregon) verso il 1985.</history>
        <ingredients>Lievito lager o ale americano pulito (lievito tedesco da weizen è inappropriato). Una discreta quantità di malto di frumento (spesso 30-50%) che però è meno di quello che si usa nelle weiss tedesche. Tipicamente luppoli americani, tedeschi o pacifici.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Più luppolata ma con meno carattere di lievito delle Weizen tedesche. Non ha mai il gusto di banana e di chiodi di garofano. In genere somiglia come equilibrio alle ale bionde ma col frumento che impartisce il gusto primario del malto.</comparison>

      <notes>Le International Lager sono birre premium per il mercato di massa e prodotte in gran parte dei paesi del mondo. Sia che derivino da stili americani o europei, tutte tendono ad avere un carattere alquanto uniforme e sono diffusamente distribuite. Derivano dalle lager tipo Pilsner originali, con variazioni di colore e maggiore gusto di malto, anche se la maggior parte dei consumatori la trova gradevole e non impegnativa. Per molti paesi si farà riferimento al nome locale dello stile. Il termine internazionale non significa che tutte le birre di questa categoria sono etichettate come tali, più che altro è un raggruppamento di birre simili prodotte a livello globale.</notes>

        <impression>Lager chiara molto attenuata senza gusti decisi, tipicamente ben equilibrata e molto gasata. Servita fredda è rinfrescante e dissetante.</impression>
        <aroma>Aroma di malto da basso a medio-basso di cereale o leggermente dolce/mais. L’aroma di luppolo varia da bassissimo a medio con presenza speziata o floreale. Anche se è desiderabile un profilo fermentativo pulito, non è un errore se si percepisce un sentore di lievito (leggero fruttato di mela).

        <appearance>Da paglierino chiaro a dorato. Schiuma bianca e densa che può non essere persistente. Molto limpida.</appearance>
        <flavor>Gusto di cereale maltato da basso a moderato con finale ben attenuato, secco e fresco. Il gusto di cereale può essere in qualche modo neutro o avere leggeri sentori di pane/cracker o un lieve dolce di malto/mais. La luppolatura varia da assente a media e spesso presenta un carattere floreale, speziato o erbaceo, se si riesce a percepire. L’amaro va da medio-basso a medio. L’equilibrio varia da leggermente maltato ad appena amaro ma in genere è abbastanza in equilibrio. Retrogusto neutro con leggera persistenza di malto e talvolta luppolo. Accettabili basse quantità di DMS.</flavor>

        <comments>Le International Lager tendono ad avere minori succedanei della lager americane, quindi possono essere di solo malto anche se non sono ammessi gusti forti. Vasta categoria di lager internazionali di massa che varia dalle lager americane di alto livello alle tipiche “import” o “birre internazionali in bottiglia verde” che si trovano in vari mercati esteri. Spesso è etichettata come Pilsner creando confusione. Se nelle bottiglie verdi si coglie aroma di puzzola si tratta di colpo di luce: una cattiva gestione del prodotto e non una caratteristica dello stile.</comments>
        <history>Negli USA si è sviluppata come versione premium della lager standard e quindi ha una storia simile. Fuori dagli Stati Uniti si è sviluppata come imitazione delle lager americane o come una versione più economica (spesso più secca e meno amara) della Pilsner. È spesso diffusamente distribuita ed esportata dalle grandi multinazionali birrarie.</history>
        <ingredients>Orzo distico o esastico. Può essere di solo malto o avere aggiunte di riso, mais o zuccheri.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Generalmente più amara e soddisfacente della lager americana. Meno luppolata e meno amara delle Pils tedesche. Meno corpo, meno gusto di malto e meno carattere di luppolo delle Pilsner ceche Premium Pale Lager. Versioni più robuste possono avvicinarsi come aromi alle Munich Helles, anche se non maggiori caratteristiche di succedanei.</comparison>

      <name>Czech Lager</name>
      <notes>Le lager ceche sono generalmente suddivise in classi di gravità (leggera, lager, speciale) e colore (chiara, ambrata, scura). I nomi cechi per queste categorie sono světlé (chiara), polotmavé (ambrata), and tmavé (scura). Le classi di gravità sono výčepní (leggera, 7–10 °P), ležák (lager, 11–12 °P), and speciální (speciale, 13 °P+). Pivo è naturalmente il nome ceco per birra. La divisione in classi di gravità è simile a quella tedesca di schankbier, vollbier, and starkbier, anche se con differenti numeri. Le birre ceche sono citate nelle singole classi semplicemente con la gravità. Ci sono spesso variazioni all’interno dei raggruppamenti in colore e gravità, soprattutto nella classe speciální. Le linee guida combinano queste classi, anche se altre birre presenti sul mercato ceco non sono dettagliate (come le porter ceche). Ciò non significa che le categorie citate esauriscano tutte le birre ceche, ma è un modo semplice di raggruppare alcune delle birre più note a scopo di giudizio ai concorsi.</notes>
      <notes>Le lager ceche sono differenziate da quelle tedesche o altre lager occidentali dal momento che quelle tedesche sono quasi sempre ben attenuate, mentre le ceche hanno solitamente una minima parte di estratto non fermentato nella birra finita. Questo comporta una FG lievemente più elevata (e quinddi minore attenuazione apparente), corpo leggermente più pieno e un aroma più complesso in birre equivalenti per colore e forza. Le lager tedesche tendono ad avere un profilo fermentativo più pulito, mentre le ceche sono spesso fermentate a minore temperatura (7-10°C) per un periodo più lungo e possono avere un minimo accenno (alle soglie di percezione) di diacetile che spesso è colto come un corpo più rotondo piuttosto che in aroma e gusto (un diabetico significativamente burroso è un difetto). I ceppi di lievito per lager ceche non sono sempre così puliti e attenuativi come quelli tedeschi, e aiutano ad ottenere una FG più alta (assieme ai metodi di ammortamento e alle temperature di fermentazione). Le lager ceche sono ottenute tradizionalmente con ammortamenti e decozione (spesso decozione doppia), anche coni malti moderni, mentre le lager tedesche sono realizzate con ammortamenti a infusione singola o multistep. Queste differenze caratterizzano la ricchezza, il boccato e il profilo aromatico che distingue le lager ceche.</notes>

        <name>Czech Pale Lager</name>
        <impression>Lager ceca con corpo leggero, ricca, rinfrescante, luppolata, amara e fresca. Ricorda il gusto familiare delle birra pils ceche più forti ma con contenuto alcolico inferiore, un corpo più leggero e un po’ meno intensità.</impression>
        <aroma>Pane da leggero a moderato combinato con un bouquet speziato o erbaceo da leggero a moderato, l’equilibrio tra malto e luppolo può variare. Accettabile un vago sentore di caramello. Il diacetile è tra nullo e moderato ma mai invadente. Esteri derivati dal luppolo leggeri e fruttati sono accettabili ma non è necessaria la loro presenza. Niente solfuri.</aroma>

Molto gustosa ma rinfrescante. Il diacetile o gli esteri fruttati sono accettabili a bassi livelli, ma la loro presenza non è necessaria e non dovrebbe mai coprire il resto.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo da leggero-medio a medio. Carbonazione moderata.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Il nome dello stile in ceco è Světlé Výčepní Pivo</comments>
        <history>Josef Groll all’inizio produsse due tipi di birra nel 1842-3: una výčepní e una ležák, con la birra più leggera prodotta in quantità doppia rispetto alla seconda. Evan Rail ipotizza che queste erano probabilmente a 10 °P e 12 °P, ma la výčepní avrebbe potuto essere anche più leggera. Questa è la birra maggiormente consumata al momento in Repubblica Ceca.</history>
        <ingredients>Acqua dolce con basso contenuto di solfati e carbonati. Luppolo Saaz, malto Pilsner ceco e lievito ceco per lager. Tradizionalmente prodotta per decozione e con fermentazione a freddo per lungo periodo. I pochi ioni presenti nell’acqua danno un profilo di amaro decisamente morbido e rotondo nonostante le grosse quantità di luppolo impiegate. La fermentazione può talvolta creare diacetile.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Birra da tutti i giorni, rinfrescante con meno corpo e meno intensità della Premium Pale Lager ceca.</comparison>

In Repubblica Ceca, solo la Urquell è chiamata Pilsner nonostante quanto il nome sia utilizzato nel mondo. Le versioni Kvasnicové (“birra con lievito”) sono popolari in Repubblica Ceca e possono essere realizzate con kräusen di mosto e lievito oppure con lievito fresco dopo la fermentazione.

      <name>Pale Malty European Lager</name>
      <notes>La categoria include lager tedesche maltose, chiare, caratterizzate da malto Pilsner con forza tra vollbier e starkbier. Pur se maltose, sono bene attenuate e pulite come molte birre tedesche.</notes>

        <name>Munich Helles</name>
        <impression>Lager tedesca pulita, maltata di color oro con gusto delicato di cereale dolce e finale morbido e secco. Sottile luppolatura speziata, floreale o erbacea con amaro limitato che contribuisce a mantenere l’equilibrio maltato ma non dolce; tutto ciò rende questa birra una bevanda rinfrescante per tutti i giorni.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderato aroma di malto - cereale dolce iniziale. Aroma di luppolo speziato, floreale o erbaceo da basso a moderatamente basso. Un aroma pulito è desiderabile ma è tollerata una leggera nota di DMS. Profilo fermentativo piacevole e pulito col malto che domina l’equilibrio. I prodotti più freschi hanno un aroma maltato/dolce.</aroma>
        <appearance>Da giallo medio a dorato chiaro. Schiuma bianca cremosa e persistente.</appearance>
        <flavor>Inizio moderatamente maltato con note di dolcezza e malto (cereale/dolce) che danno una sensazione rotonda e morbida al palato, sostenuta da un amaro che varia da basso a medio-basso. Il finale  è morbido e secco, non fresco e pungente. Luppolo floreale o erbaceo da basso a moderatamente basso. Il malto domina sul luppolo al palato, nel finale e nel retrogusto dove si dovrebbe percepire. Non dovrebbe esserci dolcezza residua ma semplicemente la sensazione di maltosità con amaro ridotto. I prodotti molto freschi sembreranno più dolci per via del malto fresco e ricco che col tempo svanisce. Profilo fermentativo pulito.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo e carbonazione nella media. Morbida e ben lagerizzata.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Pils completamente attenuata dove il malto dà del suo meglio. Le Helles sono birre maltose ma non eccessivamente dolci dove la luppolatura sottostante gioca un ruolo di supporto. Gli esemplari per l’esportazione perdono rapidamente la loro ricca maltosità che spesso suggerisce dolcezza. Le Helles di Monaco tendono ad essere più leggere sotto ogni aspetto rispetto a quelle prodotte fuori città che possono essere più decise e con più corpo, gusto e luppolatura.</comments>
        <history>Create a Monaco nel 1894 dalla Spaten per competere con le chiare tipo Pilsner. Oggi è lo stile più popolare in Germania meridionale.</history>
        <ingredients>Malto Pilsner continentale, varietà tradizionali tedesche di luppolo tipo Saaz, lievito tedesco per lager pulita.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Simile alla Munich Dunkel per equilibrio del malto e della luppolatura ma meno dolce e più tendente al chiaro che allo scuro. Ha maggior corpo e più presenza di malto della Pils tedesca con minor luppolatura. Profilo di malto simile alla Export tedesca ma con meno luppolo nell’equilibrio generale.</comparison>

        <impression>Lager tedesca chiara e pulita con maltosità moderatamente elevata e luppolatura leggera. Rappresenta un abile equilibrio tra forza e bevibilità con gusto e finale che invitano a berne ancora. Mette in mostra i gusti eleganti del malto tedesco senza essere troppo pesante.</impression>
        <aroma>Maltosità moderata con enfasi su aromi di pane tostato e impasto di pane e impronta generale di dolcezza. Luppolatura floreale, erbacea o speziata da bassa a medio-bassa. Il malto non si dovrebbe cogliere troppo tostato, caramellato o biscottato. Fermentazione da lager pulita.</aroma>
        <appearance>Da giallo intenso a oro intenso senza nessuna sfumatura di ambrato. Chiarezza luminosa e schiuma da bianca a color crema, persistente. La maggior parte degli esempi in commercio sono di colore dorato medio.</appearance>
        <flavor>Inizialmente gusto di malto da medio a medio-alto con toni di tostato e impasto di pane e una sensazione di morbida dolcezza. Amaro da medio-basso a medio, decisamente maltata nell’equilibrio generale. Ben attenuata e fresca ma non secca. Luppolo floreale, erbaceo o speziato da medio-basso a medio. Fermentazione da lager pulita. Il gusto è dato principalmente dal malto Pils ma con leggeri sentori di tostato. L’amaro fa da supporto ma dovrebbe consentire un finale gustoso di malto.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo medio con struttura delicata in qualche modo cremosa. Carbonazione media. L’alcol si nota appena per la sensazione di calore.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Questo stile rappresenta la birra che si serve all’Oktoberfest (anche se non è strettamente riservata all’Oktoberfest: può essere bevuta anche ad altre “fest”), talvolta chiamata Wiesn (prato, ovvero il nome locale dell’Oktoberfest). Abbiamo scelto di chiamarla Festbier dal momento che, secondo i regolamenti tedeschi e della UE, Oktoberfestbier è un nome protetto per le birre prodotte dalle grandi birrerie che producono dentro i confini della città di Monaco e prodotte per l’Oktoberfest. Negli altri paesi queste regole non valgono, quindi molti birrifici artigianali in USA producono birra chiamata Oktoberfest basata sullo stile tradizionale che in questa guida si chiama Märzen.</comments>
        <history>Dal 1990 la maggior parte delle birre servite all’Oktoberfest di Monaco è in questo stile. La birra da esportazione fatta specificamente per gli USA è invece ancora di color ambrato come lo sono le interpretazioni prodotte in America. La Paulaner fu la prima a creare la versione color oro a metà degli anni ’70 perché ritenevano che la tradizionale Oktoberfest saziasse eccessivamente e quindi svilupparono una versione più chiara e più bevibile, ma sempre maltosa, che voleva essere “più beverina” (da quanto dichiarato dal mastro birraio capo della Paulaner). Ma la birra effettivamente servita all’Oktoberfest è decisa da un comitato cittadino di Monaco.</history>
        <ingredients>Malto Pils soprattutto, ma con aggiunte di malto Vienna e/o Monaco per aumentare la maltosità. Le differenze nei prodotti commerciali sono più dovute alle diversità dei malti e dei lieviti, che non alla ricetta.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Meno intensa e meno tostata della Märzen ma più corposa della helles e con maggior amaro e alcol. Meno ricca di intensità del malto della Maibock. La complessità del malto è simile alla Premium Pale Lager ceca a maggior grado alcolico senza però avere i corrispondenti luppoli.</comparison>

        <impression>Lager tedesca maltata, robusta e relativamente chiara con finale ben attenuato che aumenta la bevibilità. La luppolatura è più evidente rispetto ad altre Bock.</impression>
        <aroma>Cereale dolce da moderato a forte, spesso con leggero tostato ma con bassi livelli di prodotti di Maillard. Aroma di luppolo da nullo a moderatamente basso e, se presente, ha qualità speziate, floreali o erbacee. Profilo fermentativo pulito con esteri fruttati da nulli a bassi. Lievissimo alcol si nota, come pure un basso livello di DMS.</aroma>
        <appearance>Da dorato intenso ad ambrato chiaro. Limpidezza buona a brillante e schiuma cremosa, bianca, persistente e imponente.</appearance>
        <flavor>Il gusto da moderato a moderatamente forte dei malti (cereale-dolce di malto con interessanti note tostate e/o prodotti di Maillard). Caramello da nullo a scarso, può avere un leggero DMS. Luppolatura da nulla a moderata (speziata, erbacea, floreale e pepata). Amaro moderato (più elevato rispetto ad altre Bock) e profilo di fermentazione pulito. Birra ben attenuata, non stucchevole e con finale moderatamente secco che può evidenziare sia malto che luppolo.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo medio con carbonazione da moderata a moderatamente alta. Delicata e pulita senza asprezza o astringenza nonostante le quantità di luppolo. Presenza limitata di alcol che riscalda.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>E' nota anche come Mai Bock ma si discute se la Helles (chiara) e la Mai (di maggio) Bock siano sinonimi. Molti concordano che siano identiche, altri ritengono che la Maibock sia una birra “da feste” arrivando ai limiti superiori dello stile per luppolatura e colore. Il fruttato presente è dovuto al malto Munich o ad altri malti speciali e non dagli esteri derivati dal lievito durante la fermentazione. Il luppolo equilibra i pochi prodotti della reazione di Maillard.</comments>
        <history>Prodotto relativamente recente rispetto alle altre birre della famiglia delle Bock. La Maibock è chiaramente associata alla primavera e in particolare al mese di maggio.</history>
        <ingredients>Malto base Pils e/o Vienna con aggiunte di malto Munich per impartire più carattere (anche se in minor quantità rispetto alle Bock tradizionali). Nessun succedaneo aggiunto. Luppoli tipo Saaz. Preferibile acqua dolce con pochi minerali per evitare asprezze. Lievito da lager pulito. Tipicamente si realizza in decozione ma con bollitura più breve rispetto alle Dunkles Bock tradizionali per evitare una colorazione eccessiva.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Possiamo pensarla come una versione chiara di una Dunkles Bock tradizionale o una Helles di Monaco prodotta con alcolicità da Bock. Anche se abbastanza maltosa, questa birra è meno scura e ha meno gusti di malto della Dunkles Bock tradizionale. Può anche essere più secca e più amara delle Dunkel Bock e ha più maltosità ed è più alcolica delle Festbier.</comparison>

        <impression>Birra pulita, fresca e ben bilanciata con carattere delicato di fruttato e luppolo. La maltosità latente conduce a un finale rinfrescante e piacevolmente ben attenuato. La freschezza è molto importante in questa birra perché il suo carattere delicato può svanire col passare del tempo. Un limpidezza brillante è caratteristica.</impression>
        <aroma>Malto da basso a bassissimo con toni di cereale-dolce. Accettabile ma non sempre presente un sottile fruttato di mela, ciliegia o pera derivante dalla fermentazione. Un basso aroma di luppolo floreale, speziato o erbaceo è opzionale ma non è fuori stile. Alcuni ceppi di lievito possono impartire un profumo leggermente vinoso o sulfureo (caratteristica opzionale da non considerarsi un errore). In generale, l’intensità dei componenti aromatici è alquanto sottile ma in genere ben bilanciata, pulita e fresca.</aroma>
        <appearance>Da dorato spento a dorato chiaro, molto limpida (le versioni commerciali autentiche sono filtrate fino ad essere di una chiarezza brillante). Ha una schiuma bianca e delicata che può non persistere a lungo.</appearance>
        <flavor>Palato morbido e rotondo che ha un equilibrio gustativo delicato che spazia da malto delicato ma ben attenuato, a un fruttato dolce quasi impercettibile proveniente dalla fermentazione, un amaro da mediobasso a medio con un secco delicato e freschezza nel finale senza retrogusto aspro. Il malto tende ad essere cereale-dolce, possibilmente con lievi sentori di pane o miele. La luppolatura è variabile da bassa a moderatamente alta ma la maggior parte dei prodotti hanno una intensità da medio-bassa a media con tonalità floreali, speziate o erbacee. All’inizio potrebbe dare una impressione di maltato-dolce ma la caratteristica non è necessaria. Non dovrebbe avere evidente dolcezza residua. Può avere accenti leggermente vinosi, minerali o sulfurei che in questo caso accentuano il secco e l’equilibrio dei gusti. Un leggero gusto di frumento è raro ma non sarebbe un errore. In ogni caso, il gusto è molto pulito.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo da medio-leggero a medio (più spesso medio-leggero) con carbonazione da media a medioalta. Delicata, generalmente fresca e ben attenuata.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>In Germania si caratterizza per essere una lager a fermentazione alta. Ogni birreria di Colonia produce birre di carattere differente e ciascuno interpreta la Kölsch Konvention in modo leggermente diverso. Quando la si giudica è bene pensare a queste variazioni. Notare che le versioni più secche possono sembrare più luppolate e più amare rispetto alla IBU specificata in etichetta. A causa del loro delicato profilo  gustativo, le Kölsch dovrebbero essere consumate giovani, le bottiglie più vecchie presentano facilmente dei difetti di ossidazione. Servita a Colonia in un bicchiere alto e stretto da 200 ml chiamato Stange.</comments>
        <history>Colonia ha una tradizione brassicola ad alta fermentazione fin dal Medioevo, ma quella che si chiama Kölsch è stata creata nel tardo 19° secolo per combattere la concorrenza delle lager chiare a bassa fermentazione. Kölsch è un appellativo protetto dalla Kölsch Konvention (1986) e solo una ventina di produttori di Colonia e dintorni possono usarlo. La Konvention definisce questa birra semplicemente come “Vollbier leggera, molto attenuata, con luppolatura accentuata, limpida e a fermentazione alta.”</history>
        <ingredients>Luppoli tradizionali tedeschi (Hallertau, Tettnang, Spalt o Hersbrucker) e malto tedesco Pils o Pale. Lievito ale pulito e attenuante. Si può usare fino al 20% di malto di frumento ma è raro nelle versioni autentiche. L’attuale pratica commerciale è quella di fermentare ad alta temperatura, maturare a freddo per un breve periodo e servire giovane.</ingredients>
        <comparison>L’assaggiatore poco esperto la confonde facilmente per con una Cream Ale o una simil-Pils delicata.</comparison>

        <aroma>Luppolo da basso a medio, tipicamente di carattere floreale, speziato o erbaceo. Aroma di malto moderato di cereale-dolce e profilo fermentativo pulito. Una leggera nota sulfurea iniziale che poi svanisce non è un errore e neppure una lieve nota sottostante di DMS.</aroma>

        <comments>Talvolta è conosciuta come Dortmunder o Dortmunder Export. Prodotta a una gravità leggermente più alta delle altre lager chiare, ha un corpo ben definito e una maltosità sottostante che fa da complemento alla luppolatura accentuata dai solfati. Il termine Export è un descrittore del contenuto alcolico secondo la tradizione birraria tedesca ma non è uno stretto sinonimo con lo stile Dortmunder. Birre provenienti da altre città o regioni possono essere prodotte come Export ed essere etichettate come tali (anche se non necessariamente esportate).</comments>
        <history>Lo stile Dortmunder si sviluppò nella regione industriale di Dortmund nel decennio 1870 come risposta alle birre chiare tipo Pilsner. Divenne molto popolare dopo la seconda guerra mondiale ma declinò negli anni ’70. Altre birre tipo Export si sono sviluppate in maniera indipendente, creando prodotti leggermente più alcolici delle Export in circolazione. Lo stile tedesco moderno è tipicamente 12-13 °P.</history>
        <ingredients>Acqua con alti livelli di solfati, carbonati e cloruri, luppoli nobili tedeschi o cechi, malto Pilsner e lievito tedesco per lager. Le versioni commerciali più recenti possono contenere succedanei ed estratto di luppolo.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Meno luppoli da aroma e più corpo di una Pils ma più amara di una Helles.</comparison>

        <impression>Birra amara tedesca a bassa fermentazione di corpo leggero, molto attenuata e di color oro che presenta una eccellente ritenzione della schiuma e un elegante aroma floreale di luppolo. Fresca, pulita e rinfrescante, la Pils tedesca mette in mostra i malti e i luppoli tedeschi di ottima qualità.</impression>
        <aroma>Malto cereale dolce da basso a medio-basso (spesso con leggere note di miele e cracker poco tostato) e aromi di luppolo floreali, speziati o erbacei. Profilo fermentativo pulito ma potrebbe avere una leggera nota sulfurea proveniente dall’acqua ma anche dal lievito. La luppolatura può essere da moderatamente bassa a moderatamente alta ma non dovrebbe dominare completamente sul malto. Gli esempi con una sola di queste caratteristiche sono da ritenersi di qualità inferiore rispetto a quando si percepiscono tutti gli ingredienti. Può inoltre avere una nota di fondo di DMS.</aroma>
        <appearance>Da paglierino a dorato chiaro e da luminosa a molto limpida con schiuma bianca cremosa e persistente.</appearance>
        <flavor>L’amaro del luppolo (da medio ad alto) domina il palato e rimane nel retrogusto. Il maltato da moderatamente basso a moderato ha un gusto dolce da cereale e bilancia la luppolatura che è floreale, speziata o erbacea e spazia da leggera ad elevata. Profilo di fermentazione pulito, risulta secca o mediosecca con finale ben attenuato, fresco e retrogusto amaro e allo stesso tempo con lieve malto. Gli esempi prodotti con acqua ricca di solfati hanno un basso sulfureo che accentua la secchezza ma allunga il finale; il tutto è accettabile ma non obbligatorio. Altre versioni hanno un finale morbido con più malto ma permane un amaro percettibile, con equilibrio verso l’amaro.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo medio-leggero e carbonazione da media ad alta.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Gli esempi moderni di Pils tendono ad essere più chiari, più secchi nel finale e più amari muovendosi dal sud verso il nord della Germania, spesso rispecchiando la maggior quantità di solfati presenti nell’acqua. Le Pils bavaresi tendono a essere un po’ più morbide in amaro e avere più malto e più luppolatura nel finale, ma comunque con sufficiente luppolatura e freschezza nel finale da differenziarsi dalle Helles. In Germania è più usato il termine Pils rispetto a Pilner, per differenziarsi e (sostengono alcuni) per mostrare rispetto allo stile ceco della Pilsner.</comments>
        <history>Stile ripreso dalla Pilsner ceca per adattarsi alle condizioni di produzione in Germania, con particolare riguardo ad acque con alti contenuti minerali e varietà nazionali di luppolo. Prodotta in Germania per la prima volta nel decennio 1870, divenne più popolare dopo la seconda guerra mondiale quando le scuole brassicole tedesche si concentrarono sulle tecniche moderne di produzione. Assieme alla sorella Pilsner ceca, rappresenta il prototipo e progenitore degli stili birrari maggiormente prodotti al mondo in questi anni. La IBU di diversi ben noti esempi commerciali è diminuita con gli anni.</history>
        <ingredients>Malto Pilsner continentale e varietà di luppolo tedesco (tipo Saaz come Tettnanger, Hallertauer e Spalt per gusto e aroma; il Saaz è meno comune), lievito da lager tedesco.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Rispetto a una Premium Pale Lager ceca è più leggera di corpo e di colore, più secca, meglio attenuata, fresca con amaro più persistente e con carbonazione maggiore. Ha più carattere di luppolo, di malto e amaro delle International Pale Lager. Infine ha più carattere di luppolo con finale più secco e fresco rispetto alle Munich Helles che hanno più gusto di malto delle Pils, ma della medesima caratteristica delle Pils.</comparison>

      <notes>Questa categoria raggruppa lager ambrate a bassa fermentazione, di origine tedesca con un equilibrio tendente al malto e gravità da vollbier a starkbier.</notes>
      <subcategory id="6A"><name>Märzen</name><impression>Lager ambrata tedesca elegante e maltosa con gusti di malto puliti, ricchi e dal sentore di pane (tostato), con amaro limitato e finale secco che spinge a berne ancora. L’impressione globale data dal malto è morbida, elegante e complessa con retrogusto ricco che non è mai stucchevole o pesante.</impression><aroma>Moderato malto tedesco, tipicamente ricco aroma di pane, anche tostato, con leggere note di crosta di pane. Fermentazione lager pulita e nessun aroma di luppolo. I profumi di malto caramellato, torrefatto o biscottato non sono appropriati. Si può percepire alcol moderato ma mai pungente. L’aroma di malto pulito ed elegante dovrebbe essere quello primario.</aroma><appearance>Da arancio-ambrato a un intenso ramato-rossiccio, non dovrebbe essere dorata. Limpidezza brillante con schiuma persistente color crema.</appearance><flavor>Il gusto iniziale di malto suggerisce spesso la dolcezza, ma il finale è da moderatamente secco a secco. La maltosità è ben distinta e complessa e spesso presenta profili di pane e di pane tostato. L’amaro è moderato e il gusto del luppolo varia da nullo a basso (luppoli tedeschi complessi, floreali, erbacei o speziati). Il luppolo conferisce buon equilibrio alla maltosità e il finale non appare dolce. Il retrogusto è maltoso con gusti eleganti e ricchi di malto che indugiano in bocca. Sono inappropriati gusti evidenti di caramello, biscotto o torrefatto. Profilo fermentativo lager pulito.</flavor><mouthfeel>Corpo medio con struttura delicata e cremosa che spesso regala un senso di pienezza. Birra con carbonazione media e pienamente attenuata senza essere dolce o stucchevole. Può dare un senso di calore alcolico ma questo dovrebbe essere relativamente in secondo piano.</mouthfeel><comments>Le versioni moderne di birra Oktoberfest per consumo nazionale sono di colore dorato come una robusta Helles – vedi lo stile Festbier per questa versione. Le birre tedesche Export (almeno quelle per gli USA) invece sono tipicamente arancio-ambrate, hanno un carattere distinto di malto e sono spesso etichettate Oktoberfest. Le versioni artigianali americane delle Oktoberfest sono generalmente basate su questo stile e la maggior parte degli americani riconoscerebbe questo stile come Oktoberfest. Le versioni storiche tendevano ad essere più scure, verso il marrone, ma sono esistiti molte sfumature di Märzen (quando il nome è utilizzato come rafforzativo). la descrizione dello stile si riferisce in modo specifico a versioni ambrate più forti. La moderna Festbier può essere approssimativamente descritta come una Märzen più chiara.</comments><history>Come suggerisce il nome, è prodotta come una “birra di marzo” pi forte e lagerizzata in fredde cantine in estate. Le versioni moderne originano dalle lager sviluppate da Spaten nel 1841, in contemporanea allo sviluppo della Vienna. Tuttavia, il nome Märzen è ben più antico del 1841; le prime erano marrone scuro e in Austria il nome implicava una gravità più alta (14 °P) piuttosto che uno stile. La versione ambrata tedesca (nello stile viennese dell’epoca) fu servita per la prima volta all’Oktoberfest del 1872 e la tradizione durò sino agli anni 1990, quando la Festbier dorata fu adottata come birra standard della festa.</history><ingredients>I malti variano, anche se le versioni tradizionali tedesche insistono sul malto Munich. Quel tocco di eleganza deriva da ingredienti di primissima qualità, in particolare dai malti base. Il ricco profilo di malto è ottenuto con l’ammostamento a decozione.</ingredients> <comparison>Non così forte e ricca come la Dunkles Bock, più profondità e ricchezza di malto della Festbier, con maggior corpo e un po’ meno luppolo. Meno luppolata ma egualmente maltata rispetto alla Amber Lager ceca.</comparison><examples>Buergerliches Brauhaus Saalfeld Ur-Saalfelder, Hacker-Pschorr Original Oktoberfest, Paulaner Oktoberfest, Weltenburg Kloster Anno 1050</examples><tags>forza standard, ambrata, bassa fermentazione, lagerizzata, Europa centrale, stile tradizionale, famiglia lager ambrate, maltosa.</tags><stats><og flexible="false"><low>1.054</low><high>1.060</high></og><fg flexible="false"><low>1.010</low><high>1.014</high></fg><ibu flexible="false"><low>18</low><high>24</high></ibu><srm flexible="false"><low>8</low><high>17</high></srm><abv flexible="false"><low>5.8</low><high>6.3</high></abv></stats></subcategory>
      <subcategory id="6B"><name>Rauchbier</name><impression>Una lager ambrata tedesca elegante e maltosa, complementare al carattere di faggio affumicato. Le caratteristiche sono ricco malto tostato in aroma e gusto, amaro limitato, affumicati da basso ad elevato, profilo fermentativo pulito e finale attenuato.</impression><aroma>Miscela di affumicato e malto con equilibrio e intensità variabili. Il carattere affumicato di legno di faggio può variare da lieve ad alquanto forte, dando profumi di fumo, legno o pancetta. L’aroma di malto è da basso a moderato e in qualche modo ricco, tostato o dolce. Le componenti malto e fumo sono spesso inversamente proporzionali (cioè se aumenta l’affumicato diminuisce il malto e viceversa). L’aroma di luppolo è da nullo a molto basso, fermentazione lager pulita.</aroma><appearance>Deve essere una birra molto limpida con schiuma ricca e generosa, cremosa e di colore variabile dal marrone-rossiccio al crema. Il colore varia dal ramato-ambrato al marrone scuro</appearance><flavor>Segue di solito il profilo aromatico con una miscela di affumicato e maltato, variabile come equilibrio e intensità, tuttavia complementari. Si dovrebbero notare caratteristiche simili alle Märzen, in particolare la ricchezza di malto e di tostato, ma l’affumicato da faggio può essere da basso ad alto. A livelli alti l’affumicato può assumere il carattere di prosciutto o pancetta, il che è accettabile fintanto che non si ha gusto oleoso. Il  palato è in qualche modo ricco, maltato-dolce ma il finale tende ad essere da medio-secco a secco con il gusto di affumicato che evidenzia il secco del finale. Il retrogusto può riflettere sia la maltosità che l’affumicato in modo bilanciato. L’amaro è moderato ed equilibrato. Gusto di luppolo da nullo a moderato con note speziate, floreali o erbacee. Fermentazione pulita da lager. Inappropriate sono le caratteristiche di asprezza, amaro, bruciato, carbonizzato, sulfureo o fenolico nell’affumicato.</flavor><mouthfeel>Corpo medio con carbonazione da media a medio-alta. Carattere lager delicato. Una significativa asprezza da fenoli è da considerarsi inappropriata.</mouthfeel><comments>In tedesco Rauchbier significa “birra affumicata”. L’intensità dell’affumicato varia parecchio e non tutti gli esempi sono molto affumicati. Quando si giudica, tenere in considerazione questo fatto. In Germania si trovano altre birre affumicate basate su svariati stili come Dunkles Bock, Weissbier, Dunkel, Schwarzbier e Helles, includendo esempi simili alla Spezial Lager: queste birre dovrebbero essere incluse nella categoria Classic Style Smoked Beer. Questa descrizione si riferisci in modo specifico alla versione Märzen affumicata.</comments><history>Specialità storica della città di Bamberg nella Franconia bavarese. Il malto affumicato con legno di faggio si usa per produrre una lager ambrata in stile Märzen. Il tono di affumicato del malto varia a seconda dei maltatori e alcuni birrifici producono il proprio malto affumicato (rauchmalz).</history><ingredients>Il Rauchmalz Tedesco (malto tipo Vienna affumicato con faggio) costituisce tipicamente dal 20 al 100% del cereale, il resto del malto è tedesco del tipo usato nella Märzen.

        <aroma>Profumo di pane-malto da medio a medio-alto e spesso con moderate quantità di prodotti di Maillard e/o sfumature aggiuntive di tostato. Virtualmente nessun aroma di luppolo.

        <appearance>Da ramato chiaro a marrone con spesso attraenti riflessi color granato. La lagerizzazione dovrebbe impartire una buona limpidezza nonostante il colore scuro. Schiuma abbondante, cremosa, persistente e di color crema.</appearance>
        <flavor>La ricca maltosità complessa è dominata dai ricchi e tostati prodotti di Maillard. Possono essere presenti note di caramello. L’amaro è generalmente a un livello da sostenere i gusti del malto, permettendo però alla dolcezza di rimanere nel finale. Birra ben attenuata e non stucchevole con profilo fermentativo pulito, anche se il malto può impartire un leggero carattere fruttato. Nessun gusto di luppolo e neppure di tostato o bruciato.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo da medio a medio-pieno con carbonazione da moderatamente bassa a moderata. Si può percepire calore dall’alcol ma mai a un livello eccessivo. Delicata senza astringenza o asprezza.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>La decozione e la lunga bollitura giocano un ruolo importante nello sviluppo dei gusti perché accresce il caramello e i prodotti di Maillard del malto. Il fruttato è dato dal malto Munich e altri malti speciali e durante la fermentazione non si sviluppano esteri derivati dal lievito.</comments>
        <history>Ha origine nella città di Einbeck nel nord della Germania. Questa città era un centro brassicolo e grande esportatore ai tempi della Lega Anseatica (dal 14° al 17° secolo). Questa birra fu poi ricreata a Monaco a partire dal 17° secolo e Bock rappresenta una storpiatura del nome Einbeck in dialetto bavarese e cominciò a essere usato dopo che la birra arrivò a Monaco. Bock significa anche “ariete” in tedesco e questo animale è spesso usato nel logo e in pubblicità.</history>
        <ingredients>Malti Vienna e Munich; raramente una minima quantità di malti Roasted per dare colore. Mai succedanei del malto. Luppoli dell’Europa continentale e lievito tedesco per lager pulito.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Più scura e con più gusto malto e meno amaro apparente delle Helles Bock. Meno alcol e ricchezza di malto della Doppelbock. Gusto di malto maggiore e con più alcol della Märzen. Più ricca, meno attenuata e meno luppolata della Amber Lager ceca.</comparison>

Fermentazione lager pulita.</flavor><mouthfeel>Corpo da medio-leggero a medio con una cremosità morbida. Carbonazione moderata, delicata e finale moderatamente fresco.</mouthfeel><comments>Birra di tutti i giorni di media alcolicità e non una birra prodotta per i festival. Le versioni americane possono essere un po’ più forti, più secche e più amare mentre le versioni europee tendono a essere più dolci. Molte lager ambrate e scure messicane erano più autentiche, ma sfortunatamente ora sono dolci, ricche di succedanei così come le lager internazionali ambrate e scure. Spiace notare che molti esempi moderni usano prodotti succedanei che indeboliscono la ricca complessità del malto rispetto ai migliori esempi di questo stile. Questo stile sarà probabilmente spostato nella categoria birre storiche nelle prossime edizioni della guida; ciò consentirà di descrivere lo stile classico, mentre le versioni moderne più dolci saranno incluse negli stili International Amber or Dark Lager.</comments><history>Birra sviluppata da Anton Dreher a Vienna nel 1841: divenne popolare nell’ultima parte del 19° secolo. Nella sua area di origine è quasi estinta, mentre lo stile continua in Messico dove fu portato da Santiago Graf e altri emigranti austriaci produttori di birra nel tardo 1800. È sempre più difficile trovare esempi autentici (tranne forse tra le birre artigianali) poiché quelli che una volta erano buoni prodotti ora sono diventati dolci e con più succedanei.</history><ingredients>Il malto Vienna fornisce un profilo leggermente tostato e ricchi e complessi prodotti di Maillard. Come per le Märzen, si dovrebbe usare solo malto di prima qualità insieme a luppoli continentali (preferibilmente di tipo Saaz o Styrian). Si può usare malto caramello o malti più scuri per aggiungere colore e dolcezza, ma il caramello non deve impartire aroma e gusto significativi e i malti scuri non devono apportare torrefatto.</ingredients><comparison>Minor carattere di malto, leggermente meno corpo e un po’ più amara della Märzen, tuttavia ancora decisamente tendente al malto e ai suoi aromi derivati. La maltosità è simile a quella della Märzen ma più equilibrata. Meno alcolica della Märzen o della Festbier. Meno ricca, meno maltosa e meno centrata sul luppolo rispetto alla Amber Lager ceca.</comparison><examples>Cuauhtémoc Noche Buena, Chuckanut Vienna Lager, Devils Backbone Vienna Lager, Figueroa Mountain Danish-style Red Lager, Heavy Seas Cutlass Amber Lager, Schell’s Firebrick</examples><tags>forza standard, ambrata, bassa fermentazione, lagerizzata, Europa centrale, stile tradizionale, famiglia lager ambrate, equilibrata</tags><stats><og flexible="false"><low>1.048</low><high>1.055</high></og><fg flexible="false"><low>1.010</low><high>1.014</high></fg><ibu flexible="false"><low>18</low><high>30</high></ibu><srm flexible="false"><low>9</low><high>15</high></srm><abv flexible="false"><low>4.7</low><high>5.5</high></abv></stats></subcategory>

        <impression>Birra tedesca ben bilanciata e ben attenuata, amara ma maltosa, pulita e delicata di colore variabile da ambrato a ramato. L’amaro è bilanciato dalla ricchezza del malto ma l’intensità e il carattere del malto variano da moderato ad alto (l’amaro aumenta con l’intensità a ricchezza del malto).</impression>
        <aroma>Pulito ma robusto e complesso aroma di cereali e luppoli speziati con esteri fruttati contenuti (da bassi a medio-bassi). Il carattere del malto riflette la varietà di malto base tedesco che ha ricche note di pane cotto e crosta di pane tostato o di frutta secca. L’aroma di luppolo varia da basso a moderato con sentori pepati, speziati, floreali, erbacei o profumi associati ai luppoli tipo Saaz.</aroma>
        <appearance>Il colore varia da ambrato chiaro a ramato intenso tendente al marrone; l’arancione-bronzo è il più comune. Limpidezza brillante e schiuma densa, cremosa, persistente di color crema.</appearance>
        <flavor>Amaro deciso ma ben bilanciato dal carattere robusto, ma pulito e fresco, del malto. La presenza del malto è moderata da una attenuazione che va dal medio-alta ad alta, con gusti ricchi e complessi di malto e cereale che permangono. Alcuni esteri fruttati (ciliegia soprattutto) possono superare la lagerizzazione. Il finale persistente, da medio-secco a secco, dolce-amaro o di frutta secca riflette sia l’amaro del luppolo che la complessità del malto. La luppolatura speziata, pepata o floreale è da bassa a moderata. Nessuna asprezza o torrefatto presenti. Il livello apparente di amaro è talvolta mascherato dal malto: l’amaro può sembrare basso o moderato se il finale non è molto secco. Opzionali note sulfuree o minerali.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo medio, delicata e con carbonazione da media a medio-alta anche se può essere inferiore nel caso sia servita dalla botte. L’astringenza varia da nulla a bassa. Nonostante sia molta ricca di gusto ha un corpo sufficientemente leggero da essere consumata come sontuosa session-beer nei brewpub di Düsseldorf.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Birra ad alta fermentazione, fermentata a basse temperature (15°-20°C) e spesso maturata a temperature da bassa fermentazione (circa 10°C) e poi lagerizzata a basse temperature per ottenere un palato più pulito e delicato delle tipiche ale. La Zum Uerige è una birra meravigliosa ma molto più aggressiva in amaro e complessa di molti altri esempi tedeschi. Si può paragonare alla Fuller ESB della categoria Strong Bitter – ben nota ma in qualche modo stilisticamente ai limiti. Non bisogna giudicare tutte le Altbier come se fossero clone della Zum Uerige, ma si permetta un amaro più bilanciato (25-35 IBU è più tipico per la maggior parte degli altri esempi tedeschi). Le più forti sticke e doppelsticke non dovrebbero essere iscritte in questa categoria.</comments>
        <history>Stile tradizionale di Düsseldorf, “Alt” (vecchio) fa riferimento al vecchio stile di produzione (cioè usando lievito ad alta fermentazione) che era comune prima che diventasse popolare la bassa fermentazione). È antecedente all’isolamento dei ceppi a bassa fermentazione, anche se ha molte caratteristiche delle lager a bassa fermentazione. Molti degli esempi classici si trovano nella Altstadt (città vecchia) di Düsseldorf.</history>
        <ingredients>I malti variano, ma di solito vi sono malti base tedeschi (solitamente Pils, talvolta Munich) con piccole quantità di Crystal, Chocolate e/o malti Black per aggiustare il colore. Occasionalmente c’è del frumento, anche torrefatto. Il luppolo Spalt è tradizionale ma si possono usare anche altri luppoli tipo Saaz. Lievito ale molto attenuante. Tradizionale l’ammostamento a step o con decozione.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Più amara e più maltata delle lager ambrate internazionali. In qualche modo simile alla California Common sia nella tecnica di produzione che nel gusto e colore finale ma non negli ingredienti.</comparison>

        <comments>Versioni giovani, non filtrate e non pastorizzate degli stili tradizionali tedeschi, tradizionalmente servita alla spina dalle botti di lagerizzazione. Letteralmente il nome significa “birra da cantina” implicando con questo termine una birra fresca e giovane servita direttamente dalla cantina di lagerizzazione. Dal momento che questo metodo di servire la birra può essere applicato a un’ampia gamma di prodotti, lo stile è in qualche modo difficile da identificare a parole. Tuttavia ci sono parecchie varianti comuni che si possono descrivere e usare come schema di paragone per altre versioni. Talvolta è descritta come Naturtrüb (torbida naturale) e altre volte è chiamata Zwickelbier dal nome del rubinetto usato per testare la birra dai fusti di fermentazione.</comments>
        <history>Originariamente il termine Kellerbier si riferiva a qualsiasi lager in maturazione nelle grotte o nelle cantine sotto il birrificio. Nel diciannovesimo secolo Kellerbier era una birra forte e invecchiata che doveva arrivare sino all’estate (Sommerbier), immagazzinata in cantine in pietra e servite direttamente da qui, ma quando si cominciò a usare la refrigerazione il senso del termine cambiò e ora descrive birre speciali servite giovani direttamente dalla cantina o dal fusto di lagerizzazione. Oggi alcuni produttori usano il termine puramente per scopi di marketing per far sembrare speciali le loro birre. Mentre Kellerbier è talvolta considerato più uno stile di servizio che uno stile di birra, questa tecnica di servizio è ancora usata in modo predominante con determinati stili in alcune regioni: la Helles nella zona di Monaco o la Märzen in Franconia.</history>
        <entryinstructions>Il concorrente deve specificare se la birra è una Pale Kellerbier (chiara, basata sulle Helles) o una Amber Kellerbier (ambrata, basata sulla Märzen). Il concorrente può anche specificare un altro tipo di Kellerbier basato su altri stili quali Pils, Bock, Schwarzbier ma deve fornire ai giudici una descrizione dello stile.</entryinstructions>

        <name>Kellerbier: Pale Kellerbier</name>
        <notes>Birra estiva stagionale comune prodotta da molti dei birrifici della zona di Monaco e servita nei beer garden.</notes>
        <impression>Helles giovane e fresca che mette in rilievo il malto Pils pienamente attenuato. Il carattere del luppolo (aroma, gusto e amaro) è più pronunciato e la birra è torbida spesso con un certo livello di diacetile e talvolta con note di mela verde e/o altri derivati del lievito. Come per le tradizionali Helles, le versioni Keller sono birre che devono essere bevute in litri, quindi complessivamente dovrebbe rimanere una leggera, rinfrescante, facile da bere lager dorata.</impression>
        <aroma>Aroma di luppolo speziato, floreale o erbaceo da moderatamente basso a moderatamente alto. Diacetile da molto basso a moderato e possibili note molto lievi di mela verde o altri derivati del lievito. Aroma pulito di malto, cereale-dolce con possibile lieve nota di sottofondo di DMS.</aroma>
        <appearance>Torbidezza da leggera a moderata ma mai eccessiva. Colore da giallo medio a dorato chiaro e schiuma bianca cremosa e persistente. Se servita dalla botte, può avere una carbonazione bassa e una altrettanto bassa testa di schiuma.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderatamente maltata con un profilo rotondo di cereale-dolce. Gusto di luppolo speziato, floreale o erbaceo da basso a moderatamente alto con l’amaro moderato che può permanere in bocca. Il finale è fresco e secco ma il retrogusto rimane di malto. Diacetile da lieve a moderato ma che deve rimanere a un livello gradevole di bevibilità e allo stesso tempo bilanciare le altre caratteristiche della birra; l’eccessivo diacetile non è appropriato. Possibili lievi note di mela verde o altri derivati del lievito e una lieve nota di sottofondo di DMS.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo medio e carbonazione da bassa a media. A seconda della quantità di lievito in sospensione, può contribuire a creare una struttura leggermente cremosa. Il diacetile può impartire una leggera burrosità/untuosità sulla lingua.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>La maggior parte delle Pale Kellerbier sono versioni delle Munich Helles giovani, non filtrate e non pastorizzate, anche se è possibile usare la Pils o altra lager chiara indicata a essere servita giovane. Gli esempi migliori sono serviti solo alla spina in molti dei birrifici nella zona di Monaco. Le versioni in bottiglia non hanno probabilmente la stessa freschezza, la luppolatura e le note di birra giovane evidenziate dalle versioni alla spina.</comments>

        <name>Kellerbier: Amber Kellerbier</name>
        <notes>Lo stile originale di Kellerbier proveniente dalla regione della Franconia. Uno stile molto più antico rispetto alla più recente Pale Kellerbier in stile Helles, popolare oggi nella zona di Monaco.</notes>
        <impression>Birra giovane, non filtrata e non pastorizzata, il colore sta tra la Helles e la Märzen, più speziata nella luppolatura e con maggior attenuazione. Le interpretazioni variano nel colore e nell’equilibrio ma si attestano sui 4.8% ABV, molto beverine. L’equilibrio varia dalle interpretazioni secche, speziate e chiare come la St. Georgen e la Lowenbrau di Buttenheim a birre più scure e maltose nella zona della Fränkische Schweiz. Questo stile è soprattutto un metodo per produrre birre semplici e beverine per le comunità locali con ingredienti indigeni e da servirsi giovane. Queste birre devono essere focalizzate sulla bevibilità e la digeribilità.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderata intensità di malto tedesco, tipicamente ricco, con aroma pane, anche tostato, con lievi note di crosta di pane. Aroma di luppolo speziato e pepato da moderatamente basso a moderato. Diacetile da molto basso a basso e occasionalmente solfuri da bassi a moderatamente bassi con note molto leggere di mela verde o altri derivati del lievito. Non sono appropriati aromi di malto caramellato, biscottato o torrefatto.</aroma>
        <appearance>Da limpida a moderatamente torbida a seconda dell’età, ma mai troppo torbida. Colore da dorato a rosso-ambrato intenso e schiuma cremosa color avorio. Se servita dalla botte, può avere una carbonazione bassa e una altrettanto bassa testa di schiuma.</appearance>
        <flavor>L’iniziale gusto di malto può suggerire dolcezza, ma il finale è da moderatamente secco a secco e leggermente amaro. La maltosità elegante e complessa spesso manifesta sentori di pane e di tostato. L’amaro varia da moderato a moderatamente alto con la luppolatura speziata o erbacea variabile da bassa a moderatamente alta. L’equilibrio può essere verso il malto o verso il luppolo ma il finale non è dolce. Sono inappropriati gusti evidenti di malto caramello o torrefatto. Diacetile da bassissimo a basso con possibile presenza appena percettibile di mela verde o altre note di derivati del lievito. Finale delicato e maltato.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo medio con struttura cremosa e carbonazione media. Birra fermentata pienamente senza tracce di dolce o stucchevole.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>I migliori esempi di Amber Kellerbier sono serviti solo alla spina dai piccoli birrifici della Franconia, poiché è una birra che si serve meglio giovane e la modalità di servizio è parte integrante dello stile. Le versioni in bottiglia probabilmente non hanno la stessa freschezza, la luppolatura e le caratteristiche di birra giovane evidenziate dalle versioni alla spina.</comments>
        <history>Classico stile storico adattato anche in altre zone. Lo stile originale semplicemente consisteva in birra servita nelle taverne locali che non lagerizzavano abbastanza a lungo da farla diventare completamente limpida. Molti birrifici della Franconia usano parte di questa birra giovane durante i mesi estivi per feste come la Annafest (iniziata nel 1840) a Forchheim dove era tradizione bere direttamente dalle botti di maturazione.</history>
        <ingredients>I malti variano, anche se le versioni tradizionali tedesche enfatizzano il malto Pale della Franconia. L’eleganza deriva dagli ingredienti locali di alta qualità, in particolare i malti. Comune il luppolo Spalt o altri luppoli tipici locali speziati. I frugali birrai di Franconia raramente usavano la decozione per gli alti costi dell’energia.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Solitamente è una versione giovane, non filtrata e non pastorizzata della Helles o della classica Märzen ambrata. Le versioni della zona della Fränkische Schweiz hanno un colore ambrato scuro o marrone.</comparison>

        <name>Munich Dunkel</name>
        <impression>Birra caratterizzata da complessità, profondità e ricchezza tipica dei malti Munich più scuri insieme ai prodotti di Maillard. Gli esempi più giovani hanno gusti di pane-tostato con note di cioccolato ma mai aspri, torrefatti o astringenti. Birra decisamente orientata verso il malto tuttavia bevibile con molta facilità.</impression>
        <aroma>Dolcezza intensa di malto ricca ed elegante, tipicamente crosta di pane (spesso tostata). Sentori di cioccolato, frutta secca, caramello e/o toffee sono accettabili; le versioni tradizionali giovani evidenziano spesso alti livelli di cioccolato. Profilo fermentativo pulito. Accettabile un leggero aroma di luppolo speziato, floreale o erbaceo.</aroma>
        <appearance>Da ramato intenso a marrone scuro, spesso con un tono rosso o granato. Schiuma cremosa da chiara a marrone-rossiccio, di solito limpida anche se esistono versioni non filtrate torbide.</appearance>
        <flavor>Dominato dal complesso morbido e ricco dei malti scuri Munich e di solito con toni che ricordano la crosta di pane tostata ma senza l’asprezza del cereale tostato. Al palato è moderatamente maltata anche se non dovrebbe essere dominante o stucchevolmente dolce. Possono essere presenti lievi note di caramello, pane tostato o frutta secca. Gli esempi molto giovani hanno spesso un piacevole carattere di maltocioccolato che però non è torrefatto o dolce. I gusti di bruciato o di amaro provenienti da malti torrefatti non sono appropriati come non lo sono gusti pronunciati di caramello da malto Crystal. L’amaro è moderatamente basso ma percepibile e l’equilibrio generale tende alla maltosità. Il gusto di luppolo varia da nullo a basso e, se si nota, dovrebbe riflettere le varietà tedesche floreali, speziate o erbacee. Il retrogusto permane maltato anche se l’amaro può divenire più palese nel finale medio-secco. Carattere da lager con profilo fermentativo pulito.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo da medio a medio-pieno che impartisce una sensazione di morbidezza e di destrine senza mai essere pesante o stucchevole. Carbonazione moderata. L’uso di malti continentali tipo Munich dovrebbe conferire ricchezza, non astringenza.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Le versioni tedesche non filtrate possono sembrare pane liquido con una ricchezza terrosa o di lievito che è assente nelle versioni filtrate per l’export.</comments>
        <history>Lo stile classico di birra scura di Monaco che si è sviluppato come birra più scura e maltosa di altre lager regionali. Lo stile ha avuto origine a Monaco ma si è diffuso in tutta la Baviera, specialmente in Franconia. Le versioni franconi sono spesso più scure e più amare.</history>
        <ingredients>La base di malto è Munich (in certi casi fino al 100%) e il rimanente è Pilsner tedesco. Piccole quantità di malto Crystal possono aggiungere destrine e colore ma non dovrebbero dare dolcezza residua. Si possono fare piccole aggiunte di malti torrefatti (tipo Carafa o Chocolate) per migliorare il colore ma non dovrebbero aggiungere gusti robusti. Si usano varietà di luppolo tradizionale tedesco e ceppi di lievito lager tedesco. Si impiega spesso la decozione (fino ad una tripla) per accrescere i gusti del malto e creare la profondità di colore.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Non ha l’intensità di malto della Bock e quindi se ne può bere in misura maggiore. Manca del torrefatto (e spesso dell’amaro) della Schwarzbier. Più ricca, più maltosa e meno luppolata della Dark Lager ceca.</comparison>

        <impression>Lager scura tedesca in equilibrio tra i gusti di malto torrefatto delicato e l’amaro moderato. Il corpo leggero, la sua secchezza e la mancanza di retrogusti eccessivi aspri e bruciati la rendono una birra parecchio beverina.</impression>
        <aroma>Malto da basso a moderato con bassa dolcezza aromatica di malto e/o cenni di malto torrefatto spesso evidenti. Il malto può essere pulito e neutro oppure moderatamente ricco con aromi di pane e può anche avere tracce di caramello scuro. Il carattere di torrefatto può essere di cioccolato fondente o di caffè ma non dovrebbe mai essere bruciato. Opzionale un basso aroma di luppolo speziato, floreale o erbaceo. Carattere di lievito lager pulito, anche se è possibile un leggero sulfureo.</aroma>
        <appearance>Colore marrone da medio a molto scuro spesso con riflessi intensi da rubino a granato ma mai veramente nero. Molto limpida, schiuma abbondante, persistente e marrone-rossiccia.</appearance>
        <flavor>Malto da leggero a moderato che può avere un carattere pulito e neutro con qualità moderatamente ricche di pane. Il gusto di malto torrefatto da leggero a moderato può dare un palato di cioccolato-amaro che permane nel finale ma che non evidenzia bruciato. Amaro da medio-basso a medio che permane nel finale. Gusto di luppolo speziato, floreale o erbaceo da leggero a moderato e carattere pulito da lager. Il retrogusto perdura e tende a svanire lentamente, evidenziando l’amaro di luppolo con un sottile torrefatto in sottofondo. È accettabile ma non è richiesta un po’ di dolcezza residua.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo da medio-leggero a medio e carbonazione da moderata a moderatamente alta. Delicata senza asprezze o astringenza nonostante l’impiego di malti scuri torrefatti.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Letteralmente in tedesco significa “birra nera”. Anche se talvolta è chiamata “Pils nera”, questa birra è raramente del tutto nera o amara come una Pils. Non aspettatevi gusti molto torrefatti tipo birre Porter.</comments>
        <history>Specialità regionale della Turingia, Sassonia e Franconia. I dati storici sono lacunosi, ma si presume essere originariamente una birra ad alta fermentazione. Dopo la riunificazione della Germania è cresciuta in popolarità. È servita come ispirazione per le lager nere prodotte in Giappone.</history>
        <ingredients>Malto Munich tedesco e/o malti Pilsner come base con aggiunte giudiziose di malti torrefatti (tipo Carafa) per dare il colore scuro e i gusti delicati di torrefatto. Malti scuri torrefatti decorticati possono aggiungere gusti di torrefatto senza il bruciato. Tradizionali, infine, le varietà di luppolo tedesco e lieviti puliti da lager tedeschi.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Rispetto alla Munich Dunkel è di solito più scura, più secca e più leggera di corpo e con un percepibile (ma non alto) livello di malto torrefatto che bilancia il malto base. Non dovrebbe assomigliare a una American Porter realizzata con lievito lager. Più secca, meno maltata e con meno carattere di luppolo rispetto alla Dark Lager ceca.</comparison>

      <subcategory id="9A"><name>Doppelbock</name><impression>Lager tedesca forte, ricca di gusti e molto maltata che può essere sia chiara che scura. Le versioni più scure hanno gusti di malto più ricchi e intensi mentre le versioni più chiare sono un po’ più luppolate e più secche.</impression><aroma>Intenso aroma di malto. Le versioni più scure hanno significative quantità di prodotti di Maillard e spesso aroma tostato. Accettabile un leggero aroma da caramello. Le versioni più chiare hanno una forte presenza di malto con alcuni prodotti di Maillard e note tostate. Virtualmente nessun aroma di luppolo anche se è accettabile un limitato aroma di luppolo nobile nelle versioni chiare. Note moderatamente basse di fruttato derivato dai malti possono essere presenti (ma sono opzionali) nelle versioni scure. Nelle versioni più scure può essere presente un leggerissimo aroma di cioccolato senza però torrefatto o bruciato. Può pure essere presente un moderato aroma di alcol.</aroma><appearance>Colore da dorato intenso a marrone scuro. Le versioni più scure hanno spesso riflessi rubino. La lagerizzazione dovrebbe impartire una buona limpidezza. Schiuma abbondante, cremosa e persistente (il colore varia con lo stile: bianca per le versioni chiare e crema per le varietà scure). Le versioni più forti possono avere un elevato decadimento della schiuma.</appearance><flavor>Molto ricco e maltato. Le versioni più scure avranno significativi prodotti di Maillard e spesso gusti tostati. Un leggerissimo cioccolato è opzionale nelle versioni più scure, ma non deve mai essere percepito come tostato o bruciato. Gusto pulito da lager. Alcuni fruttati derivati dai malti sono opzionali nelle versioni più scure. C’è invariabilmente una sensazione di alcolico, ma comunque dovrà essere vellutata e calda piuttosto che aspra o bruciante. Basso o nullo il gusto di luppolo (più accettabile nelle versioni chiare). L’amaro di luppolo varia da moderato a moderatamente basso ma deve sempre consentire al malto di dominare il gusto. Molte versioni sono particolarmente maltose e dolci, ma dovrebbero sempre dare la sensazione di birra ben attenuata. La dolcezza deriva da una bassa luppolatura e non da una imperfetta attenuazione del mosto. Le versioni più chiare hanno generalmente un finale più secco.</flavor><mouthfeel>Corpo da medio pieno a pieno. Carbonazione da moderata a moderatamente bassa. Vellutata, senza ruvidità o astringenza. Si percepisce il calore dell’alcol ma non il bruciore.</mouthfeel><comments>Gran parte delle versioni sono scure e presentano caramelizzazione e melanoidi derivanti dalla decozione ma esistono anche eccellenti versioni chiare. Quelle chiare non hanno la stessa ricchezza e gusto di malti scuri delle versioni più scure e possono essere un po’ più secche, più luppolate e più amare. Mentre gran parte degli esempi tradizionali ha valori minimi dei parametri citati, si può affermare che non ci sono limiti superiori riguardo alla gravità, alcol e amaro (inglobando quindi le lager molto forti).</comments><history>Specialità bavarese prodotta per la prima volta a Monaco dai monaci del monastero San Francesco da Paola. Le versioni storiche erano meno attenuate delle interpretazioni moderne, quindi erano più dolci e con meno alcol (per questo i monaci la chiamavano “pane liquido”). Il termine “Doppel (doppio) Bock” fu coniato dai consumatori bavaresi. Molte Doppelbock commerciali hanno il nome che termina in “-ator”: come tributo al prototipo che si chiamava Salvator o per sfruttarne la popolarità della birra stessa. Tradizionalmente erano di colore marrone scuro, gli esempi più chiari sono di più recente produzione.</history><ingredients>Malto Vienna e/o Pils per le versioni chiare (con un po’ di Munich) e malti Munich e Vienna per quelle scure con talvolta una minima quantità di malti da colore come il Carafa.

        <impression>Lager tedesca scura forte, maltata, ricca e di gran corpo, vischiosa e con gusti forti. Anche se i gusti sono intensi, l’alcol dovrebbe essere morbido e riscaldante, ma non troppo caldo.</impression>
        <aroma>Dominato da un equilibrio tra il maltato intenso e ricco e una presenza alcolica ben definita. Nessun aroma di luppolo, ma può avere dei significativi esteri fruttati scuri derivati dai malti. Gli aromi dell’alcol non dovrebbero essere aspri o con aromi di solvente.</aroma>
        <appearance>Colore variabile da ramato intenso a marrone scuro con attraenti riflessi rubino. La lagerizzazione dovrebbe impartire una buona limpidezza. La ritenzione della schiuma è da scarsa a moderata con colorazione da crema ad avorio intenso. Spesso sono evidenti gli archetti nel bicchiere.</appearance>
        <flavor>Malto ricco e dolce bilanciato da una significativa presenza di alcol. Il malto può avere melanoidi, avere tostature e caramello con un occasionale leggero cioccolato. Nessun gusto di luppolo mentre l’amaro bilancia il dolce del malto quel tanto che basta ad evitare di essere stucchevole. Può avere significativi esteri fruttati scuri derivati dai malti. L’alcol dovrebbe essere vellutato e non aspro o troppo caldo e dovrebbe anche aiutare l’amaro ad equilibrare il malto. Il finale dovrebbe essere di malto e alcol con una secchezza derivata dall’alcol. Non deve essere vischiosa, sciropposa o stucchevolmente dolce. Carattere di lager pulito.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo da pieno a molto pieno con carbonazione bassa. Significativo calore dato dall’alcol ma senza essere eccessivo. Molto vellutata senza asprezze derivate dall’alcol, dall’amaro, dagli alcoli superiori o da altri gusti troppo intensi.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Spesso è necessaria una lagerizzazione prolungata dopo il congelamento per ammorbidire l’alcol e migliorare l’equilibrio tra malto e alcol.</comments>
        <history>Specialità tradizionale della città di Kulmbach, prodotta congelando la Doppelbock ed eliminando il ghiaccio che si forma per concentrare i gusti e il contenuto di alcol (come pure gli eventuali difetti).</history>

        <comparison>Le Eisbock non sono semplicemente delle Doppelbock più forti. Il nome si riferisce al processo di congelamento e concentrazione della birra e non è una affermazione sull’alcolicità del prodotto: alcune Doppelbock sono più alcoliche delle Eisbock. Non è così densa, ricca o dolce come la Wheatwine.</comparison>

Birra molto complessa con stratificazioni di malto e gusti di frutta scura.</impression><aroma>Ricca dolcezza di malto che spesso presenta sentori di caramello, toffee, frutta secca fino a tostato e/o liquirizia. Profilo complesso di alcol ed esteri di forza moderata reminiscenti di prugna, susina, uvetta, ciliegia e occasionalmente vinoso tipo Porto. Presente un carattere di malto scuro che ricorda cioccolato, caffè o melassa ma mai bruciato. Nessun luppolo, né a acidità. Molto morbida.</aroma><appearance>Colore da ramato-rossiccio scuro a marrone scuro opaco (non nero). Schiuma densa e persistente color marrone-rossiccio. Limpida anche se le versioni più scure possono essere opache.</appearance><flavor>Come per l’aroma, c’è una ricca dolcezza di malto con un mix complesso di intensi esteri di frutta secca e alcol. Ha un evidente pur delicato gusto di torrefatto simile alla Schwarzbier, che non giunge mai al bruciato. Riempie bene la bocca ed è molto morbida con carattere da lager pulita. Inizia dolce ma poi dominano rapidamente i gusti di malto che persistono nel finale. Appena secca con una nota di caffè o di liquirizia nel finale. Presenti nel finale le complessità del caramello, del toffee, della frutta secca, della melassa e/o della liquirizia. Cenni leggeri di ribes nero e frutti scuri. Amaro da medio-basso a medio proveniente dal malto e dai luppoli, giusto per un corretto bilanciamento. La luppolatura leggermente speziata varia da nulla a medio-bassa.</flavor><mouthfeel>Birra di solito a corpo pieno e morbida con un calore da alcol ben maturo. Carbonazione da media a medio-alta che la rende ancora di più saziante. Sulla lingua non appare pesante grazie alla carbonazione sostenuta.</mouthfeel><comments>Oggi si può anche definire una Imperial Porter, anche se le versioni fortemente torrefatte o luppolate non sono appropriate per questo stile. La maggior parte di queste birre ha una alcolicità tra i 7 e gli 8.5% ABV. I birrifici danesi spesso le chiamano Stout e ciò indica le origini storiche dai tempi in cui Porter era utilizzato come nome generico per Porter e Stout attorno agli 8.5% ABV.</comments><history>Birra tradizionale dei paesi baltici, sviluppata in loco dopo lo sviluppo del commercio di Stout scure e alcoliche dall’Inghilterra.

Malto Black o Chocolate decorticato con malto base Munich o Vienna. Luppoli continentali (di solito tipo Saaz). Può contenere malto Crystal e/o altre aggiunte. Nelle ricette storiche erano comuni i malti Brown o Amber.</ingredients><comparison>Molto meno torrefatto e più morbida della Imperial Stout e tipicamente con meno alcol.

      <notes>Questa categoria include birre tedesche di frumento di gravità vollbier e starkbier senza acidità, con colori chiari e scuri.</notes>
      <subcategory id="10A"><name>Weissbier</name><impression>Birra di frumento tedesca chiara e rinfrescante con carbonazione elevata, finale secco, soffice in bocca e con un distinto carattere del lievito di banana e chiodi di garofano</impression><aroma>Presenza di fenoli (chiodi di garofano) da moderata a forte ed esteri fruttati (tipicamente banana). L’equilibrio e l’intensità dei fenoli ed esteri può variare ma nei migliori esempi sono ragionevolmente bilanciati e alquanto evidenti. La luppolatura varia da bassa a nulla. Può essere presente di frumento da leggero a moderato (percepito come pane o granaglie) ma non le caratteristiche di altri malti. Componenti aromatiche opzionali ma accettabili sono sentori di vaniglia da leggeri a moderati e/o un debole aroma di chewing-gum. Nessuna di queste caratteristiche opzionali deve essere intensa o dominante ma solo contribuire alla complessità e all’equilibrio.</aroma> <appearance>Colore da paglierino chiaro a dorato con caratteristica schiuma bianca molto densa, pannosa e persistente. L’alto contenuto di proteine del frumento riduce la limpidezza nelle versioni non filtrate anche se il livello di torbidezza è in qualche modo variabile.</appearance><flavor>Banana e fiori di garofano da bassi a moderatamente intensi. L’equilibrio e l’intensità dei fenoli e degli esteri è variabile ma nei migliori esempi sono ragionevolmente bilanciati e alquanto evidenti. A discrezione, vaniglia da leggerissima a moderata e/o deboli note di chewing-gum che possono accentuare il gusto di banana, la dolcezza e la rotondità; nessuno dei due, se presente, dovrebbe essere dominante. Il gusto delicato, di pane o granaglie, del frumento è complementare come lo è una lieve maltosità dolce-cereale. La luppolatura varia da nulla a molto bassa e l’amaro va da bassissimo a moderatamente basso. Al palato è ben arrotondata e gustosa con un finale relativamente secco. La percezione di dolcezza è dovuta più all’assenza di amaro da luppolo che alla dolcezza residua della fermentazione: un finale dolce o pesante rovinerebbe la sua bevibilità in modo significativo.</flavor><mouthfeel>Corpo da medio-leggero a medio, mai pesante. Il lievito in sospensione può accrescere la percezione di corpo. La struttura del frumento conferisce la sensazione di una pienezza soffice e cremosa che può evolversi in un finale leggero e spumeggiante corroborato da una carbonazione sempre molto elevata. Birra sempre effervescente.</mouthfeel><comments>Sono birre rinfrescanti a maturazione veloce, poco luppolate, che mostrano un carattere del lievito unico che offre gusto di banana e chiodi di garofano. Queste birre non invecchiano bene ed è meglio consumarle giovani e fresche. La versione “mit hefe” (con lievito) è servita col lievito in sospensione mentre la versione “krystal” è filtrata fino a ottenere una limpidezza decisa. Il carattere di una Krystal Weizen è in genere più fruttato e meno fenolico della “Weissbier mit hefe”. Può anche essere conosciuta come Hefeweizen, in particolare negli USA.</comments><history>Anche se la Baviera ha una tradizione secolare di birre al frumento, fare birra di frumento era solitamente un monopolio riservato alla nobiltà bavarese. La Weissbier moderna ha origine nel 1872 con la birreria Schneider. La Weissbier chiara divenne comunque popolare solo negli anni ’60 ed è tuttora popolare, soprattutto nella Germania meridionale.</history><ingredients>Secondo la tradizione tedesca almeno il 50% dei cereali impiegati deve essere frumento maltato, anche se alcune versioni arrivano al 70%, il resto è tipicamente malto Pilsner. Tradizionale è il metodo a decozione, anche se le moderne birrerie non seguono questa procedura. Il lievito ale per la Weizen produce il tipico carattere fruttato e speziato anche se l’alta temperatura di fermentazione può influenzare l’equilibrio e produrre dei difetti (off-flavours).</ingredients><examples>Ayinger Bräu Weisse, Hacker-Pschorr Weisse, Paulaner Hefe-Weizen Naturtrüb, Schneider Weisse Unser Original, Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier</examples><tags>forza standard, chiara, alta fermentazione, Europa centrale, stile tradizionale, famiglia birre di frumento, maltosa.</tags><stats><og flexible="false"><low>1.044</low><high>1.052</high></og><fg flexible="false"><low>1.010</low><high>1.014</high></fg><ibu flexible="false"><low>8</low><high>15</high></ibu><srm flexible="false"><low>2</low><high>6</high></srm><abv flexible="false"><low>4.3</low><high>5.6</high></abv></stats></subcategory>

Nelle versioni più chiare è maggiormente evidente un maltoso di pane e tostato in quelle più scure la presenza di malto è più ricca e intensa con quantità significative di melanoidi. La componente di malto è simile alle Helles Bock per le versioni chiare (ricco cereale dolce, leggermente tostato) o alle Dunkles Bock per le versioni scure (ricco intenso maltoso di pane, molto tostato e caramello opzionale). Il lievito conferisce il tipico profumo della Weizen di banana e spezie (chiodi di garofano, vaniglia) che può variare da mediobasso a medio-alto. Le versioni più scure possono avere qualche aroma di frutta scura (prugne, susine, uva, uvetta) particolarmente se mature. Accettabile l’aroma di alcol da basso a moderato ma non dovrebbe essere troppo caldo o avere note di solvente. Nessun aroma di luppolo. Il malto, insieme al lievito e all’alcol si sposano per produrre un bouquet complesso, invitante e ricco.</aroma><appearance>Esistono versioni chiare e scure: quelle chiare sono di colore da dorato chiaro ad ambrato pallido mentre le versioni scure variano da ambrato scuro a marrone-rubino scuro. Schiuma quasi bianca molto densa, pannosa e persistente per le versioni chiare e marrone chiaro per le versioni scure. L’alto contenuto di proteine del frumento riduce la limpidezza nelle versioni tradizionalmente non filtrate, anche se il livello di torbidezza è in qualche modo variabile. Il sedimento di lievito in sospensione può contribuire alla torbidezza.</appearance><flavor>Simile all’aroma con gusto ricco di malto da medio-alto ad alto, assieme a un significativo gusto di frumento che ricorda pane e cereale. Le versioni chiare hanno una ricca maltosità dolce (pane, tostato, cereale) mentre le versioni più scure hanno gusti di malto più intensi e più ricchi con significativa presenza di melanoidi (intenso malto, pane, malto tostato, prodotti, di Maillard con caramello opzionale). Il lievito impartisce gusti di banana e spezie (chiodi di garofano, vaniglia) da bassi a moderati. Maturando, le versioni più scure hanno gusti di frutta scura (prugne, susine, uva, uvetta). Nelle versioni più scure è opzionale un leggero cioccolato ma non torrefatto. Nessun gusto di luppolo. Il moderato amaro può dare una leggera impressione di dolce al palato ma la birra tipicamente ha un finale secco (talvolta accresciuto da un lieve tono alcolico). L’interazione tra malto, lievito e alcol aggiunge complessità e attrattiva che spesso aumenta con la maturazione.</flavor><mouthfeel>Corpo da medio-pieno a pieno. E’ tipica una struttura cremosa e soffice, come, come lo è una leggera sensazione di calore proveniente dal notevole contenuto di alcol. Carbonazione da moderata ad alta.</mouthfeel><comments>Una Weissbier prodotta con la potenza della Bock o della Doppelbock. La Schneider produce anche una versione Eisbock. Esistono le versioni chiare e scure, anche se è più comune la scura. Quelle chiare hanno meno complessità di malto e spesso più luppolo, come per le Doppelbock. I melanoidi leggermente ossidati possono produrre dei gusti ricchi e intensi e aromi che spesso si percepiscono nei prodotti commerciali maturi; le versioni più giovani non hanno queste caratteristiche. Gli esempi ben invecchiati possono anche assumere una lieve complessità che ricorda lo sherry.</comments> <history>La Aventinus, la più vecchia Doppelbock di frumento a fermentazione alta, fu creata nel 1907 nella Schneider Weisse Brauhaus a Monaco.</history><ingredients>Si usa un’alta percentuale di frumento maltato (la tradizione tedesca impone almeno il 50%, anche se può arrivare al 70%) e per il resto malti d’orzo tipo Munich e/o Vienna nelle versioni scure e malto Pils nelle versioni chiare. Si possono usare con estrema moderazione dei malti da colore. La decozione tradizionale può dare il corpo appropriato senza il dolce stucchevole. I lieviti ad alta fermentazione della Weizen producono il tipico speziato e fruttato. Una fermentazione troppo calda o troppo fredda provoca lo squilibrio di fenoli ed esteri e può creare difetti (off-flavours). La scelta del luppolo è alquanto irrilevante, ma le varietà tedesche sono per tradizione le più usate.</ingredients> <comparison>Più ricca e robusta della Weissbier o della Dunkles Weissbier ma con simili caratteristiche impartite dal lievito.

      <name>British Bitter</name>
      <notes>La famiglia delle Bitter britanniche ha origine dalle Pale Ale inglesi in fusto nel tardo 19° secolo. L’impiego di malti Crystal nelle Bitter si diffuse dopo la prima guerra mondiale. Tradizionalmente sono servite molto giovani senza pressione (per gravità o con pompa a mano) a temperatura di cantina (cioè “Real Ale”). La maggior parte delle Bitter prodotte nel Regno Unito in bottiglia o in fusto (keg) sono spesso versioni per l’esportazione più alcoliche e più carbonate di quelle prodotte in cask e hanno caratteristiche ed equilibrio differenti rispetto alle controparti britanniche (spesso più dolci e meno luppolate delle versioni in cask). Queste linee guida riflettono la versione “Real Ale” di questo stile e non le formulazioni per l’esportazione dei vari prodotti commerciali.</notes>
      <notes>Esistono parecchie variazioni regionali della Bitter, da versioni più scure e più dolci servite senza schiuma a versioni più chiare, più limpide e più luppolate con schiuma generosa e tutto quello che ci sta in mezzo.</notes>
      <notes>giudici non dovrebbero enfatizzare troppo il contenuto di caramello di questi stili. Le birre esportate potrebbero essere ossidate e questo aumenta la percezione del caramello (e di altri gusti negativi). Non bisogna presumere che gusti derivati dall’ossidazione siano tradizionali o richiesti nello stile.</notes>

        <name>Ordinary Bitter</name>
        <impression>Birra a bassa gravità, a basso tenore alcolico e bassa carbonazione di facile bevibilità (session beer). Il profilo del malto varia in gusto e intensità ma non dovrebbe mai coprire la caratteristica di amaro. La bevibilità è una componente base di questo stile.</impression>
        <aroma>Malto da basso a moderato con spesso (ma non sempre) aromi di lieve caramello. Comuni le note di pane, biscotto o lieve malto tostato. Fruttato da morbido a moderato e aroma di luppolo variabile da nullo a moderato, tipicamente con caratteristiche floreali, terrose, resinose e/o fruttate. In genere non è presente diacetile, anche se sono concessi livelli bassissimi.</aroma>
        <appearance>Colore da ambrato pallido a ramato chiaro, limpidezza da buona a luminosa e schiuma da bassa a moderata di color tra il bianco e il crema. La schiuma può essere scarsa per la bassa carbonazione.</appearance>
        <flavor>Amaro da medio a moderatamente elevato. Esteri fruttati da moderatamente bassi a moderatamente alti con luppolo tipicamente terroso, resinoso, fruttato e/o floreale. La maltosità va da bassa a media con finale secco. Il profilo del malto è tipicamente di pane, biscotto e leggermente tostato. Gusti di caramello o toffee da bassi a moderati sono opzionali. L’equilibrio è decisamente sull’amaro anche se l’amaro non dovrebbe coprire completamente il malto, gli esteri e il luppolo. In genere non è presente diacetile, anche se sono concessi livelli bassissimi.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo da leggero a medio-leggero; bassa carbonazione, anche se gli esempi in bottiglia possono essere mediamente carbonati.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>La birra a più bassa gravità nella famiglia delle Bitter britanniche, nota ai consumatori semplicemente come “Bitter” anche se i produttori la chiamano di solito Ordinary Bitter per distinguerla dalle altre birre della famiglia.</comments>
        <history>Si vedano i commenti nell'introduzione della categoria.</history>
        <ingredients>Malti Pale, Amber e/o Crystal con forse una punta di malto Dark per aggiustare il colore. Si possono aggiungere zucchero, mais o frumento.

        <comments>Oggi in Inghilterra la ESB è la portabandiera della Fullers e nessuno la considera uno stile. Una	birra unica (ma ben conosciuta) che ha un forte e complesso profilo di malto, non riscontrabile in altri esempi	e che spesso porta i giudici a penalizzare eccessivamente le Strong Bitter inglesi tradizionali. in America il	nome è stato utilizzato per descrivere birre di alcol standard (per gli americani), maltose, amare, rossicce ale	di tipo britannico ed è inoltre uno stile molto popolare per le birre artigianali. Per questo i giudici potrebbero	pensare che la ESB americana da brewpub sia rappresentativa dello stile.</comments>

Si possono considerare le Strong Bitter come una versione più	alcolica delle Best Bitter anche se non necessariamente “più premium” poiché le Best Bitter sono	tradizionalmente considerate il miglior prodotto del birraio. Le Pale Ale britanniche (ESB) sono considerate	birre amare, pallide “premium” ad alcolicità da esportazione che si avvicinano alle Strong Bitter, anche se	sono riformulate per l’imbottigliamento (compresi i maggiori livelli di carbonazione). Mentre la moderna	British Pale Ale è considerata una Bitter imbottigliata, storicamente gli stili erano differenti.</history>

        <aroma>luppolo da moderatamente basso a moderatamente alto. Qualsiasi varietà di luppolo può essere impiegata: quelli inglesi floreali, erbacei o terrosi e gli agrumati americani sono i più comuni. Spesso viene utilizzata una varietà singola di luppolo.

        <flavor>amaro da medio a medio-alto con gusto di luppolo da moderato a moderatamente alto (di qualsiasi varietà, anche se i gusti agrumati sono sempre più comuni). Maltosità da bassa a medio-bassa, con gusto di pane e forse lieve biscotto. Tipicamente assenti i gusti di caramello e diacetile da basso a nullo. L’amaro e il gusto di luppolo devono essere ben pronunciati. Esteri da bassi a moderatamente bassi. Finale da mediosecco a secco. L’amaro cresce all’aumentare del livello alcolico ma deve sempre essere equilibrato.</flavor>

        <comments>birra dissetante e ben luppolata con l’accento sul luppolo. Si serve più fredda delle Bitter tradizionali; in origine era pensata come una rinfrescante birra estiva ma ora è prodotta tutto l’anno. Prima si impiegavano luppoli inglesi ma ora si utilizzano sempre di più luppoli americani agrumati. Le Golden Ale sono anche chiamate Golden Bitter, Summer Ale o British Blonde Ale e si possono trovare in cask, in fusto e in bottiglia.</comments>
        <history>le moderne Golden Ale furono prodotte in Inghilterra per battere la concorrenza delle Lager. È difficile identificare quale fu la prima, ma molti ritengono che ad aprire la strada fu la Hop Back's Summer Lightning prodotta nel 1986.</history>

        <comparison>la più simile alle American Pale Ale anche se ha meno alcol e utilizza ingredienti britannici. Non ha caramello e meno esteri rispetto alle Bitter britanniche o alle Pale Ale. Secca come le Bitter ma meno maltosità a sostenere il luppolo, che impartisce quindi un diverso equilibrio. Si usano più spesso (e fanno bella mostra) luppoli americani rispetto ad altri stili moderni britannici.</comparison>

        <impression>delicata e bilanciata, tutti i componenti si fondono assieme con intensità simile. I gusti moderati mettono in mostra gli ingredienti australiani. Ampia diversificazione dei gusti, molto beverina e adatta al clima caldo. Si basa sulle caratteristiche del lievito.</impression>
        <aroma>pulito e alquanto delicato con un mix equilibrato di esteri, luppolo, malto e lievito: tutti da basso a moderato. Gli esteri sono spesso di pera o mela e forse con una lieve nota di banana (opzionale). I luppoli sono terrosi, erbacei o potrebbero evidenziare la caratteristica ferrosità del Pride of Ringwood. La maltosità varia da cereale neutro a moderatamente dolce o lieve pane; nessun caramello evidente. I prodotti molto giovani possono avere sottili aromi di lievito o sulfurei.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da giallo intenso ad ambrato chiaro ma spesso giallo medio. Schiuma bianca ampia, persistente e pannosa con bollicine piccolissime. Effervescenza percepibile per l’alta carbonazione. Limpidezza brillante se viene decantata, ma di solito si versa col lievito per dare un aspetto torbido. Normalmente non torbida a meno che non si porti il lievito in sospensione versandola.</appearance>
        <flavor>rotondo di malto, cereale o pane da basso a medio, inizialmente lieve maltato-dolce per poi evidenziare l’amaro da medio a medio-alto che controbilancia la maltosità. Di solito assenti i gusti del caramello. Birra estremamente attenuata dal finale secco con l’amaro che persiste, anche se il corpo suggerisce pienezza. Gusti di luppolo da medio a medio-alti un po’ terrosi, forse erbacei, resinosi, pepati o ferrosi ma non floreali e che permangono nel retrogusto. Esteri da medio-bassi a medio-alti, spesso di pera o mela e con banana opzionale ma mai dominante. Può essere leggermente minerale o sulfurea se è presente il lievito. Non deve mai essere anonima.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>carbonazione da alta ad elevata che riempie la bocca di bollicine con pizzicore caratteristico. Corpo da medio a medio-pieno e tendente al pieno se si versa col lievito. Delicata ma gassata. Le versioni più alcoliche possono dare leggera sensazione di calore. Birra molto ben attenuata che non dovrebbe avere nessuna dolcezza residua.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>la Coopers produce la sua birra ammiraglia, la Sparkling Ale fin dal 1862, anche se nel corso degli anni è cambiata la formulazione. Attualmente la birra ha una limpidezza brillante se è decantata, ma i baristi spesso versano gran parte della birra nel bicchiere poi girano la bottiglia e inseriscono tutto il lievito. In alcuni bar la bottiglia viene fatta rotolare lungo il banco! Quando è servita alla spina, la birreria istruisce i gestori a rovesciare il fusto per smuovere il lievito. I consumatori moderni sembrano preferirla torbida. È sempre carbonata naturalmente, anche nel fusto. Ale quotidiana ma che si beve meglio giovane.</comments>
        <history>gli archivi delle birrerie mostrano che la maggioranza delle birre australiane prodotte nel 19° secolo erano la XXX (Mild) alla spina e la Porter. La ale in bottiglia fu prodotta per fare concorrenza alle Pale Ale in bottiglia importate dall’Inghilterra, come la Bass e la Wm Younger’s Monk. Ai primi del 20° secolo la Pale Ale in bottiglia uscì di fuori moda e divennero di tendenza le lager “più leggere”. Molte Sparkling Ale e Pale Ale australiane furono etichettate come Ale, ma in realtà erano lager a bassa fermentazione con malti simili a quelli impiegati prima per le Ale. La Coopers di Adelaide è l’unica fabbrica rimasta a produrre lo stile Sparkling Ale.</history>
        <ingredients>malto Pale distico australiano poco tostato ma si possono usare varietà lager e piccole quantità di Crystal solo per aggiustare il colore. Gli esempi moderni non prevedono aggiunte ma solo zucchero di canna per il priming. Gli esempi storici usavano malto distico al 45%, malto esastico più proteico al 30% e zucchero al 25% per diluire il contenuto di azoto. Tradizionalmente luppoli australiani come il Cluster e Goldings, sostituiti da metà anni ’60 dal Pride of Ringwood. Lievito tipo Burton molto attenuante (tipicamente ceppo australiano). Profilo dell’acqua variabile, ma di solito con pochi carbonati e solfati moderati.</ingredients>
        <comparison>apparentemente simile alle Pale Ale britannica, anche se molto più carbonata, con meno caramello e meno luppolatura finale. Mette in mostra il ceppo di lievito e le varietà di luppolo impiegate. Più amara di quanto le IBU facciano intendere a causa dell’alta attenuazione e della bassa gravità finale e per i luppoli abbastanza “ruvidi”.</comparison>

        <impression>una Pale Ale britannica luppolata, moderatamente forte molto ben attenuata con finale secco, con aroma e gusto di luppolo. I classici ingredienti britannici forniscono il miglior profilo gustativo.</impression>
        <aroma>tipico aroma di luppolo floreale, speziato-pepato o di agrume-arancia naturale da moderato a moderatamente alto. Un aroma erbaceo da dry-hopping è accettabile ma non necessario. La presenza di aromi di malto moderatamente bassi che ricordano il caramello o il tostato sono opzionali e un fruttato da basso a moderato è accettabile. Alcune versioni possono avere una nota sulfurea, anche se non è obbligatoria.</aroma>
        <appearance>il colore varia da dorato ad ambrato intenso ma la maggior parte è abbastanza chiara. Dovrebbe essere limpida anche se le versioni non filtrate con dry-hopping possono essere un poco torbide. Schiuma di dimensioni ridotte, persistente e di color crema.</appearance>
        <flavor>luppolo da medio ad alto con amaro da moderato a dominante. Il gusto del luppolo dovrebbe essere simile all’aroma (floreale, speziato-pepato, agrume-arancia e/o leggermente erbaceo). Il malto dovrebbe essere da medio-basso a medio e talvolta con gusto di pane, con lievi caratteristiche di biscotto, di tostato, toffee e/o caramello. Fruttato da medio-basso a medio con finale da medio-secco a molto secco e amaro che persiste nel retrogusto senza asprezza. L’equilibrio pende verso il luppolo ma il malto deve essere distinguibile come supporto. Se si usa acqua con molti solfati sono solitamente presenti zolfo, un finale secco e minerale con amaro che perdura. Nelle versioni più alcoliche si può percepire un gusto di alcol pulito. Il barricato (quercia) non è appropriato per questo stile.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo morbido da medio-leggero a medio con astringenza derivata dal luppolo, anche se la carbonazione, variabile da moderata a medio-alta, può combinarsi per rendere una sensazione globale di secco, nonostante la presenza del malto come supporto.

        <comments>le caratteristiche delle IPA importanti per il loro arrivo in buone condizioni in India erano l’elevata attenuazione e la forte luppolatura. Dal momento che le IPA venivano trasportate con questa modalità, non significa che altre birre come le Porter non fossero mandate in India, o che le IPA fossero state inventate per essere mandate in India, o che le IPA fossero più luppolate di altre birre in fusto, o che il livello di alcool fosse inusuale per il tempo. Molte birre moderne etichettate come IPA sono abbastanza deboli in alcool. Secondo il CAMRA “le cosiddette IPA di circa 3.5% ABV non sono vere IPA aderenti allo stile”. Lo storico inglese della birra Martyn Cornell ha affermato che birre del genere “non sono in realtà distinguibili dalla Bitter ordinaria”. Quindi abbiamo scelto di concordare con questi autori per le nostre linee guida piuttosto che con ciò che alcuni moderni birrifici britannici chiamano IPA; ci si ricordi quindi di queste due tipologie di IPA presenti oggi sul mercato britannico.</comments>
        <history>ci sono vari resoconti sulla sua origine, ma la maggior parte degli storici concorda che quella che in seguito si sarebbe chiamata IPA era una Pale Ale preparata per essere spedita in India a fine ‘700 - primi ‘800. George Hodgson della Bow Brewery divenne un famoso esportatore di IPA ai primi ‘800 ed è il primo nome legato alla popolarità della IPA. Come per tutte le birre inglesi con una lunga storia, anche per la IPA la popolarità e la formulazione cambiarono con gli anni. Le birrerie di Burton-on-Trent con le loro acque altamente sulfuree furono in grado di produrre IPA di successo e dominarono il mercato a partire dal decennio 1830, cioè da quando si iniziò ad usare il nome IPA. Col tempo il grado alcolico e la popolarità declinarono e lo stile virtualmente sparì dal mercato nella seconda metà del 20° secolo. Si usava il nome IPA per indicare le Pale Ale e le Bitter senza particolari caratteristiche (trend che continua ancora adesso in alcuni esempi britannici moderni). Lo stile fu riscoperto dai birrifici artigianali negli anni ’80 ed è quello descritto qui. Gli esempi moderni sono ispirati dalle versioni classiche, ma non si deve pensare che abbiano un legame con quelle del passato o che abbiano lo stesso preciso profilo gustativo. White Shield è probabilmente l’esempio più antico che risale alle forti IPA di Burton, prodotta per la prima volta nel 1829.</history>

      <notes>Anche se Dark Mild, Brown Ale e le Porter inglesi hanno una lunga e leggendaria storia, queste linee guida descrivono solo le versioni moderne. Sono raggruppate assieme per il solo scopo di essere iscritte e giudicate ai concorsi dal momento che hanno spesso gusto ed equilibrio simili e non perché abbiano un passato comune. Le caratteristiche simili sono forza da bassa a moderata, colore scuro, generalmente un equilibrio verso il malto e trascorsi britannici. Questi stili non hanno avuto relazioni storiche; soprattutto, nessuno di questi stili è evoluto verso un altro o ne è stato una componente. Il nome della categoria non è mai stato storicamente utilizzato per descrivere questo gruppo di birre: è il nostro nome per la categoria di concorsi. Brown Beer è stato un distinto e importante prodotto storico e non ha nessuna relazione con il nome di questa categoria.</notes>

        <name>Dark Mild</name>
        <impression>una session-beer inglese scura, a bassa gravità, incentrata sul malto e molto adatta a essere bevuta in quantità. Rinfrescante ma molto gustosa con un’ampia gamma di sfumature del malto e dello zucchero scuro.</impression>
        <aroma>malto da basso a moderato con un po’ di fruttato. La maltosità al naso può essere descritta come caramello, toffee, cereale, tostato, frutta secca, cioccolato o appena torrefatto. Aroma di luppolo da lieve a nullo con sentori terrosi o floreali se presente. Diacetile da lieve a nullo.</aroma>
        <appearance>di colore variabile dal ramato al marrone scuro o mogano, esistono anche rari esempi più chiari da ambrato medio a marrone chiaro. È generalmente limpida, anche se tradizionalmente non è filtrata. Schiuma da color crema a marroncino da bassa a moderata ma di scarsa ritenzione.</appearance>
        <flavor>birra in genere maltosa anche se può avere un’ampia gamma di gusti originati dal malto e dal lievito (maltato, dolce, caramello, toffee, pane tostato, frutta secca, cioccolato, caffè, torrefatto, frutta, liquirizia, prugna, susina). Finale può essere da dolce a secco ma con le versioni più scure il finale è secco e torrefatto. Amaro da basso a moderato, quel che basta per dare un equilibrio senza coprire il malto. Esteri fruttati da nulli a moderati; diacetile e luppolo da nullo a basso.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da leggero a medio, con carbonazione in genere da bassa a medio-bassa. Le versioni con malto torrefatto possono essere un po’ astringenti, mentre le versioni più dolci possono sembrare alquanto corpose rispetto alla effettiva gravità.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>la maggior parte sono session-beer a bassa gravità intorno ai 3.2%, anche se alcune versioni possono essere più forti (oltre i 4%): per l’export, i festival, oppure per occasioni speciali o stagionali. Di solito è servita dal cask; le versioni più leggere in bottiglia di solito non viaggiano bene. È possibile una vasta gamma di interpretazioni. Esistono versioni chiare, ma sono ancora più rare delle mild scure; queste linee guida descrivono solamente le versioni moderne scure.</comments>
        <history>storicamente la Mild era semplicemente una birra non invecchiata e il termine poteva essere usato per distinguere le birre invecchiate o più luppolate di lunga durata. Le Mild moderne hanno la loro origine nelle ale “X” più leggere del 19° secolo, anche se le Dark Mild apparvero solo nel 20° secolo. Nell’uso corrente il termine implica una birra poco alcolica con meno amaro della Bitter. Queste linee guida descrivono la versione britannica moderna. I consumatori non amano più il termine “Mild” e molti birrifici non lo usano più. Sempre più rara. Non esiste nessuna relazione storica tra Mild e Porter.</history>
        <comparison>alcune versioni possono sembrare Porter inglesi moderne a minor gravità. Molto meno dolci rispetto alle London Brown Ale.</comparison>
        <ingredients>malto base Pale britannico (spesso ricco di destrine), malto Crystal, malti scuri o aggiunte di zuccheri scuri integrali, possibile anche l’aggiunta di fiocchi di mais e caramello per il colore. Lievito ale britannico caratterizzante e qualunque tipo di luppolo, dal momento che la luppolatura è raramente evidente.</ingredients>

        <comments>ampia categoria con diverse interpretazioni possibili: da chiara a luppolata, a molto scura e caramellata, tuttavia nessuna ha gusti fortemente torrefatti. Una più forte Double Brown Ale era popolare in passato, ma difficile da trovare oggi. Mentre le London Brown Ales sono commercializzate come Brown Ale, noi le includiamo in uno stile di giudizio differente per il significativo diverso equilibrio (specie dolcezza) e forza alcolica: ciò non significa tuttavia che non siano nella medesima famiglia.</comments>
        <history>la Brown Ale ha una lunga storia in Gran Bretagna, anche se non pochi prodotti differenti hanno usato questo nome in tempi diversi. Le moderne Brown Ale inglesi sono una invenzione come birra in bottiglia del 20° secolo e sono diverse dai prodotti storici con lo stesso nome. Si producevano con ampia gamma di alcolicità ma quelle moderne sono tutte interpretazioni più alcoliche (secondo gli attuali standard inglesi). Questo stile ha come base le moderne Brown Ale inglesi più alcoliche e non le versioni storiche o la più dolce Brown Ale londinese. Attualmente sono predominanti le versioni in bottiglia.</history>
        <ingredients>malto base britannico Mild Ale o Pale Ale con malto caramello. Può anche avere piccole quantità di malti più scuri come il Chocolate per dare colore e le note di frutta secca. Le versioni tradizionali hanno varietà di luppolo inglese.</ingredients>
        <comparison>maggior equilibrio verso il malto rispetto alle Bitter britanniche con più caratteristiche provenienti da malti scuri. Più alcolica della Dark Mild. Meno torrefatto di una English Porter. Più forte e molto meno dolcezza di una London Brown Ale.</comparison>

        <comments>la descrizione di questo stile si riferisce alla versione moderna della Porter inglese e non ogni possibile variante storica di ogni regione dove era prodotta. Rielaborazioni storiche devono essere inserite nella categoria Historical Style con una descrizione appropriata del profilo della birra. Gli esempi artigianali moderni nel Regno Unito sono più alcolici e luppolati.</comments>
        <history>la Porter ebbe origine a Londra circa 300 anni fa ed era una evoluzione delle birre scure dolci, popolari al tempo. Nel corso dei secoli si è evoluta parecchio, seguendo gli sviluppi tecnici, gli ingredienti e le preferenze dei consumatori. Divenne molto popolare e ampiamente esportata nell’800 prima di declinare intorno alla Prima Guerra Mondiale e sparire negli anni ’50. Fu re-introdotta a metà anni ’70 con la nascita delle birre artigianali. Si dice che il nome derivi dal fatto che era popolare presso i lavoratori londinesi impegnati nel carico e scarico merci. Sono esistite molte interpretazioni regionali realizzate nel tempo e precursore di tutte le Stout (che in origine si chiamavano “Stout Porter”). Non esiste nessuna relazione storica tra Mild e Porter.</history>
        <ingredients>i malti variano ma qualche varietà che impartisce il colore scuro è sempre presente. Molto comuni i malti Chocolate o altri torrefatti, il malto caramello, zuccheri fermentabili et similia. Le Porter tipo London usano spesso malto Brown come caratterizzante del gusto.</ingredients>
        <comparison>differisce dalle Porter americane in quanto ha gusti più delicati, più dolci e più caramellati, minor gravità e di solito anche meno alcol. Le Porter americane hanno di solito più carattere di luppolo. Ha più sostanza e più torrefatto della British Brown Ale e maggior gravità della Dark Mild.</comparison>

      <notes>Il significato originale di “Schilling Ale” è stato descritto in modo sbagliato per molti anni. Nessun stile di birra è mai stato denominato 60/-, 70/- o 80/-. Gli scellini si riferivano al solo costo solo della botte di birra, intendendo che c’erano Stout 54/- e IPA 86/- e via di seguito. Le Scottish Ale erano chiamate Light, Heavy ed Export, il che copriva lo spettro di costi da circa 60/- a 90/- ed erano sono semplicemente ale scure con accento sul malto. Le ale superiori a 120/- non rientrano in questa analisi, come pure le più alcoliche Scotch Ale (dette anche Wee Heavy). Le linee guida per le Scottish Light, Heavy ed Export sono da più o meno simili per ciascuno di questi stili. Col crescere della gravità aumenta il carattere delle birre in questione. Storicamente le tre tipologie di birra erano realizzate con il metodo parti-gyle (ossia dalla medesima cotta si otteneva un primo filtrato più forte e dai risciacqui birre più leggere) e rappresentavano l’adattamento locale delle pale ale inglesi con minore gravità, meno luppolo e colore più scuro (spesso da caramello aggiunto). Nelle versioni moderne (almeno quelle successive alla seconda guerra mondiale) si utilizza una più complessa miscela di malti.</notes>

        <comments>ale focalizzate sul malto che ricavano le loro caratteristiche dai malti speciali e mai dal processo di produzione. Non è tradizionale tostare il malto o gli zuccheri del mosto durante la “caramelizzazione in bollitura”, neppure avere un forte carattere di mou. Di solito è una birra da spina. L’affumicato non è appropriato; se tradizionalmente qualcuna lo manifestava era per l’uso di acqua torbata. Le ale scozzesi affumicate dovrebbero rientrare nella categoria Classic Style Smoked Beer.</comments>
        <ingredients>in origine malto Pale scozzese, mais o fiocchi di mais e caramello per il colore. Successivamente utilizzati anche altri ingredienti come malti Amber e Brown, malti Crystal e di frumento, malti torrefatti per il colore ma mai gusto percepibile di torrefatto. Lievito pulito o leggermente fruttato. Il malto torbato non è tradizionale ed è inappropriato.</ingredients>

      <notes>Le birre tradizionali irlandesi incluse in questa categoria sono da ambrate a scure, ad alta fermentazione di forza da moderata a leggermente forti e sono spesso ampiamente incomprese a causa delle differenze con i prodotti per l’export oppure oscurate dalle caratteristiche di birre ampiamente commercializzate da birrifici molto noti. Ogni stile in questa categoria ha caratteristiche ben più ampie rispetto a quanto comunemente creduto.</notes>

        <impression>birra facile da bere, spesso con gusti delicati. Leggermente maltata, talvolta con una leggera iniziale dolcezza di toffee/caramello, un palato di lieve cereale e di biscotto e un tocco di torrefatto nel finale. Alcune versioni possono enfatizzare di più la dolcezza e il caramello, mentre altre favoriscono il palato di cereale e il secco torrefatto.</impression>
        <aroma>malto da basso a moderato, da cereale neutro o con leggere note di caramello-tostato-toffee. Può avere una leggerissima burrosità (anche se non è richiesta). L’aroma di luppolo terroso o floreale varia da nullo a basso (di solito non è presente). Aroma molto pulito.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da ambrato medio a ramato-rossiccio medio. Limpida, schiuma bassa da color crema a marrone-rossiccio con persistenza media.</appearance>
        <flavor>gusto e dolcezza di malto caramellato da leggerissimo a moderato, di rado con toni leggeri di pane tostato imburrato o toffee. Il palato è spesso abbastanza neutro con sapore di cereale o può assumere una nota leggermente tostata o di biscotto che termina con un gusto lieve di cereale torrefatto che impartisce un secco caratteristico al finale. Pochi o niente esteri. L’equilibrio tende leggermente verso il malto, anche se il piccolo impiego di cereali torrefatti può aumentare di poco la percezione di amaro.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio-leggero a medio anche se gli esempi contenenti bassi livelli di diacetile possono impartire una leggera untuosità (non richiesta). Carbonazione moderata. Delicata e moderatamente attenuata.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>in questo stile esistono parecchie varianti che rendono queste linee guida un po’ generiche per poterle inglobare tutte. Gli esempi tradizionali irlandesi hanno relativamente poca luppolatura, hanno note di cereale con un leggero secco torrefatto nel finale e in generale sono abbastanza neutre. Gli esempi moderni irlandesi per l’export sono più caramellati e dolci e potrebbero avere più esteri. Le versioni artigianali americane sono spesso versioni più alcoliche delle Irish Export. La scena emergente delle birre artigianali irlandesi esplora invece le versioni più amare di quelle tradizionali. Infine, ci sono alcuni esempi commerciali che suonano Irish, ma sono in realtà International Amber lager, con palato più dolce e poco amaro. Queste linee guida si riferiscono agli esempi tradizionali irlandesi, con piccole divagazioni per le versioni Irish Export e le moderne versioni artigianali prodotte in Irlanda.</comments>
        <history>mentre l’Irlanda ha una lunga tradizione di Ale, il moderno stile Irish Red Ale è essenzialmente un adattamento o interpretazione dello stile English Bitter con meno luppolatura e un po’ di malto torrefatto per dare colore e secchezza. Riscoperta come stile di birra artigianale in Irlanda, oggi è elemento essenziale della gamma di gran parte dei birrifici, insieme alla Pale Ale e la Stout.</history>
        <ingredients>generalmente in genere ha un poco di orzo torrefatto o malto Black per impartire il colore rossiccio e il finale secco da torrefatto. Malto base Pale. I malti caramello storicamente erano importati e quindi più costosi, non tutti i birrai li usavano.</ingredients>
        <comparison>l’equivalente meno amaro e meno luppolato della English Bitter con finale secco dovuto all’orzo torrefatto. Più attenuata, con meno gusto di caramello e meno corpo delle ale scozzesi con equivalente alcolicità.</comparison>

        <impression>birra nera con pronunciato gusto di torrefatto spesso simile al caffè.

        <comments>quando un birrificio proponeva una Stout e una Porter, di solito la Stout era la più alcolica (originariamente era chiamata Stout Porter). Le versioni moderne sono prodotte a minore gravità e non sono più alcoliche delle Porter. Oggi è tipicamente un prodotto alla spina; le versioni in bottiglia hanno comunemente una gravità maggiore e sono chiamate Extra Stout. In Irlanda esistono differenze regionali come per le English Bitter. Le Stout tipo Dublino usano contengono orzo torrefatto, sono più amare e più secche. Le Stout di Cork sono più dolci, meno amare e hanno gusto di cioccolato e di malti speciali. Gli esempi commerciali sono quasi sempre serviti alla spina con carbo-azoto. Le tradizionali birre rifermentate in bottiglia non avranno la struttura piena e cremosa o la schiuma molto persistente delle versioni alla spina.</comments>
        <history>questo stile ebbe origine dai tentativi di capitalizzare il successo delle Porter londinesi, ma in origine rivelava un corpo più pieno e cremoso e una più robusta alcolicità. La Guinness iniziò a produrre Porter nel 1799 e “un più robusto tipo di Porter” intorno al 1810. La Irish Stout si diversificò dalla Single Stout londinese (la Porter) nel tardo 1800 con l’impiego di malti più scuri. La Guinness fu tra le prime birrerie ad usare malto Black brevettato Patent per le Porter e le Stout nel decennio 1820 e cominciò ad usare utilizzare orzo torrefatto dopo la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, mentre i birrai di Londra continuavano ad usare malto Brown. Guinness iniziò poi a usare orzo in fiocchi negli anni ’50 e aumentò parecchio l’attenuazione. La Guinness Draught fu lanciata come marchio nel 1959. La Draught in lattina “tipo spina” e le bottiglie furono sviluppate nei tardi anni ’80 e ’90.</history>
        <ingredients>la Guinness è prodotta usando orzo torrefatto, orzo in fiocchi e malto Pale, ma gli altri birrifici non usano necessariamente l’orzo torrefatto: possono usare malto Chocolate o altri malti scuri o speciali. Qualunque combinazione di malti si usi, la birra risultante dovrebbe essere nera. Le Stout di Cork sono forse più vicine nella composizione alle Stout storiche di tipo londinese, con una varietà di malti non dominata dall’orzo torrefatto.</ingredients>
        <comparison>meno alcolicità della Irish Extra Stout ma gusti simili. Più scura di colore (nera) della English Porter (marrone).</comparison>

        <history>prodotto più forte ma con le stesse radici della Irish Stout. La Guinness Extra Stout (Extra Superior Porter, in seguito chiamata Double Stout) fu prodotta per la prima volta nel 1821 ed era primariamente un prodotto in bottiglia. Descritta dalla Guinness come “una birra a corpo più pieno e con una più intensa caratteristica di amaro da torrefatto, struttura ricca e matura”. Di tutti i tipi di Guinness sul mercato odierno, questa è la più vicina alla Porter originale prodotta da Arthur Guinness. Si noti che oggi la Guinness Extra Stout ha diverse gravità in diverse regioni: la versione europea ha circa 4,2% e rientra nello stile Irish Stout.</history>

Esistono variazioni rispetto alla dolcezza residua, all’intensità del carattere torrefatto e all’equilibrio tra di essi: sono queste le variabili più soggette all’interpretazione personale. Alcune versioni inglesi sono molto dolci (bassa attenuazione) a anche basse in alcol (la Tennent’s Sweetheart Stout ha 2%), ma sono una anomalia rispetto agli altri esempi. Queste linee guida descrivono principalmente le versioni export con maggior gravità, più bilanciate piuttosto che le versioni a basso alcol e molto dolci che sono difficili da trovare.</comments>
        <history>stile di Stout inglese sviluppatosi ai primi del ‘900. Storicamente nota come Milk o Cream Stout, legalmente ora questa designazione non è più permessa in Inghilterra (ma è accettata altrove). Il nome Milk deriva dall’uso del lattosio o zucchero del latte come agente dolcificante. Originariamente fu immessa nel mercato come un tonico per i convalescenti o le madri in allattamento.</history>
        <ingredients>la dolcezza di gran parte delle Sweet Stout proviene dai bassi livelli di amaro rispetto alle altre Stout e dall’alta percentuale di destrine non fermentabili. Il lattosio, zucchero non fermentabile, viene aggiunto di frequente per impartire una dolcezza aggiuntiva residua. Malto pale come base e si possono aggiungere orzo tostato, malti Black, Chocolate, Crystal e pure succedanei come mais o zuccheri fermentabili.</ingredients>
        <comparison>molto più dolce e meno amara delle altre Stout (tranne la più robusta Tropical Stout). Il carattere di torrefatto è morbido e non bruciaticcio come per le altre Stout. Equilibrio in qualche modo simile a quello delle Oatmeal Stout, ma molto più dolci.</comparison>

        <comments>in generale come dolcezza si pone tra le Sweet Stout e le Irish Stout. Esistono variazioni: dal molto dolce al decisamente secco, come pure tra le versioni inglesi e americane (quelle americane tendono a essere più luppolate, meno dolci e meno fruttate). Variabile anche il livello di amaro e pure l’impronta dell’avena. Un uso limitato di avena può dare un corpo setoso e ricchezza di gusto, mentre un uso massiccio può impartire gusti molto intensi con sensazioni oleose in bocca, finale secco e una leggera astringenza da cereale. Quando si giudica, tenere presente le differenze di interpretazione.</comments>
        <history>una variante del tardo 1800 delle Stout “nutrienti e per convalescenti” con avena, analoga alla Sweet Stout con lattosio. Una versione scozzese originale utilizzava una significativa quantità di malto d’avena. Successivamente attraversò una fase ambigua in cui alcuni produttori inglesi inserivano una manciata d’avena nelle loro stout parti-gyle per ottenere una versione legalmente accetta bile e “salutare” di Oatmeal Stout per motivi commerciali. Birra molto popolare in Inghilterra tra le due guerre, ebbe un revival per l’export nell’era delle birre artigianali e questo ha contribuito alla sua popolarità quale moderno stile birrario artigianale in America caratterizzato da una buona (non simbolica) quantità di avena.</history>
        <ingredients>malti Pale, Caramel, torrefatti scuri (spesso Chocolate) e cereali non maltati. L’avena o avena maltata (5-20% o più) è usata per accrescere la pienezza di corpo e la complessità di gusto. Luppoli primariamente per l’amaro. Si possono usare zuccheri fermentabili o sciroppi. Lievito inglese per Ale.</ingredients>
        <comparison>la gran maggior parte è un incrocio tra una Irish Extra Stout e una Sweet Stout con aggiunta di avena. Esistono parecchie variazioni: le versioni più dolci assomigliano maggiormente alla Sweet Stout con avena al posto del lattosio, mentre le versioni più secche ricordano il pieno gusto di nocciolato delle Irish Extra Stout. Entrambe tendono ad enfatizzare la corposità e le sensazioni boccali.</comparison>

Versioni storiche (precedenti alla seconda guerra mondiale) avevano la medesima OG delle Extra Stout domestiche ma con un più alto livello alcolico a causa della lunga maturazione in cui i Brettanomiceti agivano in tal senso. La differenza tra versione domestiche e “foreign” erano la luppolatura e i tempi di maturazione.</comments>

        <impression>una ale di potenza alcolica rispettabile, tradizionalmente rifermentata in bottiglia e maturata a lungo. Può avere un’ampia gamma di interpretazioni, ma la maggior parte di esse ha livelli variabili di ricchezza di malto, luppoli da aroma, esteri fruttati e calore alcolico. I giudici dovrebbero concedere questa varietà di carattere: se è dentro i limiti indicati di forza alcolica e ha un interessante carattere “britannico”, allora rientra nello stile.</impression>
        <aroma>dolce-maltato con esteri fruttati, spesso con una miscela complessa di frutta secca, caramello, nocciole, toffee e/o altri aromi di malti speciali. Sono accettabili note alcoliche, ma non dovrebbero essere brucianti o di solvente. Gli aromi del luppolo possono variare molto ma tipicamente hanno note terrose, resinose e/o floreali. Equilibrio molto variabile, ma gli esempi più complessi hanno una mix di malto, fruttato, luppolo e alcol a intensità variabili.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da dorato intenso a bruno-rossiccio scuro (molte sono assai scure). Generalmente limpida, anche se le versioni più scure possono esser quasi opache. Schiuma da bassa a moderata di colore da crema a marrone-rossiccio e con media ritenzione.</appearance>
        <flavor>carattere di malto da medio ad alto spesso con cioccolato, toffee o caramello. Nelle versioni più scure si percepiscono talvolta note leggere di cioccolato e può anche avere una interessante complessità proveniente dagli zuccheri aggiunti. L’equilibrio è spesso verso il malto ma può essere anche ben luppolato, influenzando l'impronta di maltosità. Comune la presenza moderata di esteri fruttati con frutta scura o frutta secca. Il finale varia da medio-secco a leggermente dolce. Dovrebbe essere evidente l’alcol, ma non dominante. Diacetile da nullo a basso, in generale non desiderabile.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio a pieno, quasi masticabile. Il calore dell’alcol è spesso evidente e sempre desiderabile, carbonazione da bassa a moderata. Struttura morbida.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>una categoria per concorsi più che uno stile, in cui la potenza e il carattere degli esempi variano ampiamente. Questo stile sta tra le birre a gravità normale (Strong Bitter, Brown Ale, Porter inglese) e le Barleywine e può anche includere birre chiare maltate o luppolate, le Winter Warmer inglesi, le Strong Dark Mild e le più leggere Burton Ale e altre birre particolari di media gravità che non possono essere incluse in altre categorie. Tradizionalmente è un prodotto rifermentato in bottiglia, adatto a essere maturato a lungo.</comments>
        <history>il carattere varia, dal momento che questa categoria riflette un raggruppamento di stili minori non in relazione tra loro a produzione limitata. Alcune sono rifacimenti storici, mentre altre sono moderne. Alcune discendono direttamente da stili più antichi come le Burton Ale e altre mantengono un collegamento storico con birre del passato. È un’idea di raggruppamento relativamente moderna, poiché questa categoria alcolica non era insolita nei secoli passati. Non usare questa categoria per ipotizzare relazioni storiche tra i diversi esempi: questa è una categorie di specialità britanniche dove la specialità fa riferimento al livello alcolico.</history>
        <ingredients>i malti variano, spesso basati su malti Pale, caramello e altri malti speciali. Alcuni esempi di birra scura suggeriscono che i malti scuri (tipo Chocolate o Black Malt) sono appropriati, anche se si devono usare con parsimonia per evitare gusti eccessivamente torrefatti. Sono comuni le aggiunte di zuccheri e di amidacei (mais, fiocchi d’orzo, frumento). I luppoli per aroma sono tradizionalmente inglesi.</ingredients>
        <comparison>sovrapposizione significativa nella gravità con le Old Ale, ma senza quel carattere di stantio o invecchiato. È possibile un’ampia gamma di interpretazioni, ma non dovrebbe essere ricca e forte come i Barleywine inglesi. Più alcolica delle birre alcoliche di tutti i giorni (Strong Bitter, Brown Ale, Porter). Ha più carattere zuccherato e di malto speciale e zuccheri delle Strong Ale americane.</comparison>

        <impression>una ale con forza alcolica da moderata ad alquanto significativa, maggiore delle birre standard, anche se non forte e ricca come i Barleywine. L’equilibrio è spesso verso il malto. “Dovrebbe essere una birra riscaldante da bere in mezze pinte vicino ad un focolare in una fredda notte d’inverno” – Michael Jackson.</impression>
        <aroma>maltato-dolce con esteri fruttati, spesso in una miscela complessa di frutta secca, vinoso, caramello, melassa, nocciola, toffee, sciroppo di zucchero e/o aromi da altri malti speciali. Sono accettabili note di alcol e di ossidazione, simili a quelle che si ritrovano nello Sherry e nel Porto. Gli aromi del luppolo non sono di solito presenti per il lungo invecchiamento.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da ambrato chiaro a bruno-rossiccio scuro (la maggior parte è alquanto scura). L’età e l’ossidazione possono scurire ulteriormente la birra. Può sembrare opaca (se non lo è, dovrebbe essere limpida). Schiuma da bassa a moderata e di colore variabile dal crema al bruno-rossiccio chiaro, può essere influenzata negativamente dall’alcol e dall’invecchiamento.</appearance>
        <flavor>maltosità da media ad alta con una seducente complessità di nocciola, caramello e/o melassa. l gusti di cioccolato o malto torrefatto sono opzionali e non devono mai essere prominenti. L’equilibrio è spesso verso il maltato-dolce ma può anche essere verso il deciso luppolato (il carattere amaro spesso dipende dall’invecchiamento). Gli esteri fruttati da moderati ad alti sono comuni e hanno un carattere di frutta secca o vinoso. Il finale può variare da secco a dolciastro. La lunga maturazione può impartire gusti di ossidato simili a quelli dell’ottimo Sherry invecchiato, Porto o Madera. La forza alcolica deve essere evidente, anche se non sovrastante. Diacetile da nullo a basso. Alcune versioni maturate in botte o miscelate possono avere gusti di lattico o di brettanomiceti: è un fatto opzionale e comunque la loro presenza non deve essere troppo la evidente. Acidità e tannini provenienti dall’invecchiamento devono risultare ben integrati nella birra e contribuire alla complessità del profilo gustativo e non essere dominanti.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio a pieno, quasi da masticabile, anche se gli esempi più invecchiati possono avere corpo più leggero per l’attenuazione continuata durante la maturazione. Il calore dell’alcol è spesso evidente e sempre gradito. Carbonazione da bassa a moderata a seconda dell’età e della maturazione. Possono essere presenti una leggera acidità e dei tannini se maturata in botte: entrambi sono tuttavia opzionali.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>la potenza e il carattere variano ampiamente. La qualità predominante che definisce questo stile è il segno del passare del tempo che si manifesta in modi differenti (complessità, lattico, brettato, ossidazione, cuoio e vinosità, ecc.). Anche se queste qualità possono sembrare difetti, se la birra è ancora complessa e piacevole da bere, allora tali caratteristiche sono accettabili. In ogni caso, queste caratteristiche non devono giustificare una birra scorretta e imbevibile, anche se ha dei parametri che rientrano nello stile. La Old Peculier è una birra unica nel suo genere ed è parecchio differente dalle altre Old Ale.</comments>
        <history>storicamente è una Mild invecchiata (quando le Mild erano birre più alcoliche). Era usata come birra da cantina per la miscelazione o per essere bevuta tal quale (per cantina si intende birra invecchiata o tenuta per un significativo periodo di tempo). Ci sono oggi almeno due tipologie in Gran Bretagna: birre più leggere alla spina che assomigliano alle mild mature di circa 4,5% e più forti che sono spesso sui 6-8% o più.</history>
        <ingredients>la composizione è variabile anche se in genere è simile a quella delle English Strong Ale. Il fattore età è il maggior responsabile del profilo finale dello stile, più facile da gestire rispetto alla semplice produzione in se. Può essere invecchiata in botti di legno ma non deve avere un forte sapore di barricato.</ingredients>
        <comparison>pressappoco sovrapponibile alle British Strong Ale e all’estremità inferiore dei Barleywine inglesi ma sempre con le caratteristiche date dall’invecchiamento. La distinzione tra una Old Ale e un Barleywine è approssimativa sopra i 7% ABV e generalmente fa riferimento a maggiori caratteristiche di invecchiamento (in particolare dal legno). I Barleywine tendono a sviluppare caratteristiche “mature”, mentre le Old Ale mostrano maggiori caratteristiche dalla botte (lattico, Brett, vinoso, etc.).</comparison>

        <impression>ricche, maltose, destrinche e di solito dolci da caramello, queste birre sembrano un dessert. I gusti secondari complessi del malto secondario e dell’alcol le impediscono di essere una birra monodimensionale.

        <aroma>maltato intenso con una forte componente di caramello. Possono essere presenti aromi secondari leggermente affumicati che aumentano la complessità; il torbato è inappropriato. Il diacetile dovrebbe essere da basso a nullo. Esteri e alcolicità sono spesso presenti nelle versioni più alcoliche. Aroma di luppolo da nullo a molto basso e può essere leggermente terroso o floreale.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da ramato chiaro a marrone scuro, spesso con intensi riflessi rubino. Limpida con schiuma generosa che può non persistere a lungo. Archetti possono evidenziarsi nelle versioni più alcoliche.</appearance>
        <flavor>riccamente maltato con caramello significativo (specialmente nelle versioni più alcoliche). Possono essere presenti cenni di malto torrefatto (talvolta percepite come un debole affumicato) e note di nocciola che perdurano nel finale. Il torbato è inappropriato. I gusti del luppolo e l’amaro sono da bassi a medio-bassi, quindi la presenza del malto dovrebbe dominare l’equilibrio generale. Il diacetile dovrebbe essere molto basso o nullo. Sono di solito presenti il gusto di alcol ed esteri da un livello basso a moderato. Gli esteri ricordano le prugne, l’uvetta o la frutta secca. Al palato è piena e dolce, ma il finale può variare da dolce a medio-secco, talvolta con una leggera nota di cereale/torrefatto.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio-pieno a pieno, con alcune versioni (non tutte) che hanno una densa viscosità, quasi masticabile. Calore delicato dell’alcol di solito presente e gradito, dal momento che bilancia la dolcezza del malto. Carbonazione moderata.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>nota anche come Strong Scotch Ale. I termine “wee heavy” significa “piccola forte” e fa riferimento alla birra che ha reso noto il termine: Fowler’s Wee Heavy, una ale da 12 ghinee. Storicamente, la birra più forte realizzata da ale scozzese con metodo parti-gyle.</comments>
        <history>più in relazione con le birre storiche che con le ale scozzesi moderne a basso tenore alcolico, queste birre hanno le loro radici nelle Strong Ale del 1700 e 1800, anche se sono cambiate le formule e le metodologie. Prodotto premium, spesso esportato. Le versioni moderne hanno gravità iniziale e finale inferiori rispetto alle loro antenate storiche.</history>
        <ingredients>malto Pale ben modificato con orzo torrefatto per il colore. Si può anche usare del malto Crystal per aggiustare il colore. In alcune versioni può essere presente un leggero affumicato derivante dai cereali torrefatti o da una bollitura lunga e vigorosa. Il malto torbato non è assolutamente tradizionale.</ingredients>

        <impression>un tripudio di ricchezza di malto e gusti intensi e complessi. Corpo ricco, quasi masticabile, con calore alcolico e piacevole fruttato o luppolato. Quando è invecchiata può assumere gusti di Porto. Birra invernale da sorseggiare.</impression>
        <aroma>molto ricco e fortemente maltato. Le versioni più scure hanno spesso aromi simili al caramello e le più chiare un leggero carattere di toffee. Possono avere un fruttato da moderato a forte, spesso di frutta scura o secca, soprattutto nelle versioni scure. L’aroma di luppolo varia da lieve a deciso ed è tipicamente floreale, terroso o simile alla marmellata d’agrumi. Gli aromatici dell’alcol variano da bassi a moderati ma sono morbidi e rotondi. L’intensità di questi composti aromatici diminuisce spesso con l’età. L’aroma può avere un ricco carattere con note di pane, pane tostato, toffee e/o melassa. Le versioni più invecchiate hanno aromi tipo Sherry, vinoso o di Porto e in genere aromi di malto più smorzati/attenuati.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore variabile da dorato carico ad ambrato molto scuro e perfino marrone scuro (spesso con riflessi color rubino, che non dovrebbero essere opachi). Schiuma da bassa a moderata, color avorio con poca ritenzione. Potrebbe presentarsi torbida se raffreddata eccessivamente, ma in genere torna limpida e brillante con l’innalzarsi della temperatura. Il colore può avere una grande profondità, come se si guardasse attraverso una grossa lente. L’alto contenuto alcolico e la viscosità possono essere visibili negli archetti prodotti facendo ruotare il bicchiere.</appearance>
        <flavor>gusti forti, intensi, complessi di malto che variano dal pane, toffee e biscotto nelle versioni più chiare alla nocciola, tostato deciso, caramello scuro e/o melassa nelle versioni più scure. Al palato una dolcezza di malto da moderata ad alta, anche se il finale può variare dal moderatamente dolce al secco moderato (a seconda dell’età). Possono essere presenti gusti di ossidato o vinosi e spesso sono evidenti i gusti complessi dell’alcol. Fruttato da moderato a molto elevato con caratteristiche di frutta scura o secca. L’amaro del luppolo può variare da un minimo necessario per l’equilibrio ad una decisa presenza: l’equilibrio varia quindi dal maltato al lieve amaro. Le versioni chiare sono spesso più amare, meglio attenuate e con più carattere di luppolo rispetto alle versioni più scure. In ogni caso, tutte le versioni sono tendono al maltato. Gusti di luppolo da bassi a moderatamente alti, spesso varietà inglesi floreali, terrose o di marmellata di arancia.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>birra di pieno corpo e quasi masticabile, con una struttura vellutata e dolcissima (anche se il corpo può ridursi per la lunga maturazione). Dovrebbe inoltre essere presente un calore delicato dall’alcol maturo. La carbonazione è da bassa a moderata e in relazione all’età e alla maturazione.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>la più ricca e la più alcolica delle moderne ale inglesi. Il carattere dei Barleywine può cambiare in modo significativo col tempo: sia le giovani che le mature dovrebbero essere apprezzate per quello che sono. Il profilo del malto può variare molto e non tutti gli esempi posseggono l’intero spettro di gusti e aromi possibili. Le varietà più chiare non possono avere i gusti di malto ricco e caramello e neppure il tipico fruttato da frutta scura secca: non bisogna aspettarsi gusti e aromi impossibili per una birra di quel colore. Tipicamente scritto “Barley Wine” nel Regno Unito e “Barleywine” in USA.</comments>
        <history>per secoli sono state prodotte Strong Ale con varie formulazioni in Inghilterra ed erano note con varie denominazioni. I moderni Barleywine si rifanno alla Bass No. 1 che fu chiamata per prima Barleywine nel 1872. I Barleywine erano più scuri fino a che la Tennant (ora Whitbread) produsse per prima la Gold Label (un Barleywine dorato) nel 1951. Di solito è la birra più forte prodotta da una birreria e negli anni recenti sono apparsi sul mercato prodotti millesimati offerti ai consumatori come specialità invernale a serie limitata. Lo stile originale ha ispirato varianti in Belgio, USA e altrove nel mondo.</history>
        <ingredients>il malto Pale di alta qualità e ben modificato dovrebbe essere la spina dorsale, insieme a una giudiziosa quantità di malto caramello. I malti scuri devono essere usati in quantità molto ridotte, o per nulla, perché il colore proviene dalla bollitura prolungata. Sono tipici i luppoli inglesi come Northdown, Target, East Kent Goldings e Fuggles. Lievito britannico caratterizzante.</ingredients>
        <comparison>anche se è spesso ben luppolato, il Barleywine inglese pone meno l’accento sul luppolo rispetto al Barleywine americano e mette in evidenza i luppoli inglesi. Rispetto alle versioni americane, i Barleywine inglesi possono essere più scuri, più maltati, più fruttati ed evidenziare gusti più ricchi di malti speciali. SI sovrappone, nel range inferiore, alla British Old Ale, ma generalmente non ha le caratteristiche vinose da invecchiamento; piuttosto tende a mostrare i segni del tempo in modo maturo ed elegante.</comparison>

        <impression>birra artigianale americana abbordabile, facile da bere e orientata verso il malto. Ha spesso note di fruttato, di luppolo o note di malto. Birra ben bilanciata e pulita, rinfrescante senza avere gusti aggressivi.</impression>
        <aroma>dolce di malto da lieve a moderato, con possibili note di pane o caramello. Un fruttato da basso a moderato è opzionale ma accettabile.

Gusto di luppolo (qualsiasi varietà) da leggero a moderato ma non troppo aggressivo. Amaro da medio-basso a medio ma l’equilibrio tende normalmente verso il malto o in equilibrio tra malto e luppolo. Il finale varia da medio-secco a leggermente dolce-maltato; l’impressione di dolcezza è spesso una manifestazione di basso amaro piuttosto che di dolcezza residua.</flavor>

        <history>birra artigianale americana prodotta da molte micro-birrerie e brewpub, particolarmente da quelli che non possono produrre Lager. Esistono varietà regionali (molti esempi da brewpub della West Coast sono più decisi, come le Pale Ale) ma in gran parte del paese questa birra è progettata per essere la meno impegnativa della propria produzione.</history>
        <ingredients>birra in genere tutto malto ma si possono aggiungere fino al 25% di malto di frumento e zuccheri. Si può impiegare qualsiasi varietà di luppolo. Lieviti: americano pulito, inglese leggermente fruttato o Kölsch, perfino lievito lager o maturata a freddo. Alcune versioni possono contenere miele, spezie e/o frutta aggiunta, ma se qualunque dei sopracitati ingredienti viene percepito in modo netto dovrebbero essere inserite nelle categorie di birre speciali.</ingredients>
        <comparison>tipicamente ha più gusto delle American Lager e delle Cream Ale. Meno amara di una America Pale Ale.</comparison>

        <impression>ale chiara, rinfrescante e luppolata ma con sufficiente malto a supporto che la rende equilibrata e bevibile. La evidente presenza del luppolo riflette le varietà americane o pacifiche con un ampio spettro di caratteristiche gustative. Una birra artigianale americana di media alcolicità, tendente al luppolato e in generale bilanciata per essere più abbordabile rispetto alle IPA americane moderne.</impression>
        <aroma>luppolo americano o pacifico da moderato a forte, tipicamente con ampia varietà di caratteristiche, includendo note agrumate, floreali, pinose, resinose, speziate, frutta tropicale, frutta col nocciolo, frutti di bosco o melone. Non è richiesta nessuna di queste specifiche caratteristiche ma il luppolo si deve percepire al naso. Una maltosità da bassa a moderata sostiene la decisa luppolatura e può mostrare note di malti speciali (pane, pane tostato, biscotto, caramello). Gli esteri fruttati variano da nulli a moderati. Il dry-hopping (se usato) può aggiungere note erbacee, anche se la sua presenza non dovrebbe essere eccessiva.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da dorato chiaro ad ambrato chiaro. Schiuma moderatamente generosa di colore che va dal bianco all’avorio e con buona ritenzione. Generalmente ben limpida, anche se versioni col dry-hopping possono risultare leggermente torbide.</appearance>

Il maltato delicato da basso a moderato sostiene la decisa luppolatura e può mostrare lievi caratteristiche di malti speciali (pane, toast o biscotto). L’equilibrio tende normalmente verso l’amaro e il luppolo da aroma, ma la presenza del malto dovrebbe essere di supporto e non disturbare la percezione della luppolatura. I gusti del caramello sono spesso assenti o molto limitati (ma sono accettabili se non sono in conflitto col luppolo). Gli esteri fruttati del lievito sono da nulli a moderati, anche se molte varietà di luppolo sono alquanto fruttate. Amaro da moderato ad alto con finale da medio a secco. Il gusto di luppolo e l’amaro spesso permangono nel finale ma il retrogusto deve in genere essere pulito e non aspro. Il dry-hopping (se presente) può aggiungere note erbacee ma non deve eccedere.</flavor>

        <comments>vengono impiegate sempre nuove varietà di luppolo e metodologie, quindi i giudici devono accettare che queste nuove caratteristiche dei luppoli siano presenti insieme alle varietà classiche. Sta diventando uno stile artigianale internazionale, con adattamenti locali nazionali che appaiono all’interno di un emergente mercato di birra artigianale. Gli stili di luppolatura variano dalla classica aggiunta di luppolo da amaro ai più moderni esempi di forte luppolatura da aroma. Sono ammesse tutte le variazioni.</comments>
        <history>moderna birra artigianale americana e adattamento della English Pale Ale, con utilizzo di ingredienti locali (luppolo, malto, lievito e acqua). Prima dell’esplosione in popolarità delle IPA, era tradizionalmente la più nota e la più popolare birra artigianale americana.</history>
        <ingredients>malto Pale Ale, tipicamente distico nord-americano. Luppoli americani o pacifici con ampia gamma di caratteristiche. Lievito ale americano o inglese (neutro o leggermente fruttato). I malti speciali possono aggiungere carattere e complessità, ma in genere sono una piccola percentuale della lista degli ingredienti. Si usano spesso cereali che aggiungono gusto e ricchezza al malto, che danno una leggera dolcezza e note di tostato o di pane. Sono aggiunti (insieme alla luppolatura a fine bollitura) per differenziare i prodotti.</ingredients>
        <comparison>rispetto alla controparte inglese è tipicamente più chiara, ha meno sottoprodotti di fermentazione e meno gusti di caramello. Ci può essere sovrapposizione di colore tra l’American Pale Ale e l’American Amber Ale, ma la Pale Ale è più pulita, ha meno profilo di caramello, meno corpo e più luppoli nel finale. Rispetto alla American IPA è meno amara e meno alcolica. Più equilibrata e beverina e meno luppolata e amara rispetto alle IPA session-beer americane (note come Session IPAs).</comparison>

        <history>originaria della West Coast e in origine prodotta col nome di Steam Beer nel periodo della corsa all’oro. Si usavano tradizionalmente grandi fermentatori aperti e poco profondi (coolships) per compensare l’assenza di sistemi di refrigerazione e avvantaggiarsi delle fresche temperature della Baia di San Francisco. Fermentata con lievito lager ma selezionato per fermentare in modo pulito a temperatura maggiore del normale. Le versioni moderne sono basate sul modello del birrificio Anchor Brewing che ha rilanciato lo stile negli anni ’70.</history>
        <ingredients>malto Pale Ale, luppolo non agrumato (spesso il Northern Brewer), piccole quantità di malti tostati e/o Crystal. Lievito lager ma alcuni ceppi (spesso con la menzione “California” nel nome) lavorano meglio di altri a temperature di fermentazione tipicamente più alte (13°-15.5° C). Da notare che alcuni ceppi tedeschi producono un carattere sulfureo inappropriato.</ingredients>
        <comparison>l’equilibrio apparentemente è simile a quello della American Amber Ale, ma con scelte specifiche di malto e luppolo; il gusto/aroma del luppolo è quello dei luppoli tradizionali americani (non quelli moderni), i gusti del malto sono più tostati, la luppolatura è sempre decisa e si usa un lievito lager a temperature più elevate.

        <aroma>moderato malto tra il dolce e il complesso-ricco con note di cioccolato, nocciola e/o tostato. L’aroma di luppolo è tipicamente da basso a moderato e qualsiasi varietà che faccia da complemento al malto. Alcune interpretazioni dello stile possono evidenziare un aroma di luppolo più elevato, caratteristico di luppoli americani o pacifici (agrumato, fruttato, tropicale, ecc.) e/o un fresco aroma da dry-hopping (tutti opzionali). Gli esteri fruttati vanno da molto bassi a moderati. Il carattere di malto scuro è più deciso che nelle altre Brown Ale, tuttavia non arriva ad assomigliare ad una Porter. Il malto e i luppoli sono in genere bilanciati.</aroma>

        <comments>gran parte delle American Brown commerciali non sono aggressive come le versioni casalinghe o come alcuni moderni esempi artigianali. Questo stile riflette le offerte commerciali attuali, vendute come American Brown Ale piuttosto che le versioni casalinghe più luppolate e più alcoliche degli albori dell’homebrewing. Queste Brown Ale con l’alcolicità delle IPA dovrebbero rientrare nella categoria Specialty IPA come Brown IPA.</comments>

La Pete’s Wicked Ale fu uno dei primi e più noti esempi che ispirò molte imitazioni. Molto popolare presso gli homebrewer, le cui versioni molto luppolate erano talvolta chiamate Texas Brown Ale (ora più appropriatamente chiamate Brown IPA).</history>

      <notes>Queste birre si sono evolute dalle corrispondenti inglesi e sono state interamente trasformate dai produttori artigianali americani. In genere sono più robuste, più alcoliche, più torrefatte e centrate sul luppolo delle loro cugine inglesi. Questi stili sono raggruppati assieme per la loro storia e per il loro profilo gustativo comuni.</notes>

        <impression>birra scura maltata e sostanziosa con un carattere complesso e pieno impartito dal malto scuro.</impression>
        <aroma>malto scuro da leggero-medio a medio-forte, spesso con leggero bruciato. Può anche essere presente un carattere aggiuntivo di malto complesso e/o dolce come supporto (cereale, pane, toffee, caramello, cioccolato, caffè). Aroma di luppolo da basso ad alto e spesso resinoso, terroso o floreale. Possibili aromi da dry-hopping. Esteri fruttati da nulli a moderati.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore che può avvicinarsi al nero, ma solitamente va dal marrone medio al bruno molto scuro, spesso con riflessi rubino o granato. Essendo parecchio scura è difficile identificare la limpidezza, ma in controluce si dovrebbe notare se la birra non è opaca. Schiuma generosa di colore marroncino e persistenza moderatamente buona.</appearance>
        <flavor>malto moderatamente forte che di solito mostra caratteristiche di leggero bruciato (e talvolta gusti di cioccolato e/o caffè) insieme a un accenno di secchezza da malto scuro e di cereale nel finale. Il gusto globale può risultare da secco a medio-dolce. Può avere dell’asprezza derivante dai cereali scuri torrefatti, ma non palesemente acre, bruciata o aspra. Amaro da medio ad alto che può essere accentuato dal malto scuro. Il gusto di luppolo varia da basso ad alto con caratteristiche resinose, terrose o floreali e in generale bilancia i gusti del malto scuro. Il malto scuro e il luppolo non dovrebbero essere in conflitto. Le versioni con dry-hopping possono avere un gusto resinoso. Esteri fruttati da nulli a moderati.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio a medio-pieno. Carbonazione da bassa a moderatamente alta. Le versioni più forti possono presentare un leggero calore alcolico. Può essere un poco astringente per i malti scuri, ma questa caratteristica non deve essere marcata.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>è uno stile alquanto aperto a differenti interpretazioni. L’intensità del malto scuro e il gusto può variare in maniera significativa. Può avere una forte luppolatura e significativi sottoprodotti della fermentazione; può quindi assumere caratteristiche “americane” o “britanniche”.</comments>
        <history>si tratta di una versione più forte e più aggressiva delle Porter pre-Proibizionismo e/o delle Porter inglesi prodotte artigianalmente. Sono esistite versioni storiche, in particolare nella costa orientale, dove sono ancora prodotte (vedasi la sezione Historical Beer, Pre-Prohibition Porter). Qui invece è descritta la versione moderna artigianale.</history>
        <ingredients>si possono utilizzare svariati malti, con prevalenza di quelli scuri e spesso con malto Black oppure Chocolate. Tipicamente si usa luppolo americano per l’amaro e inglese/americano per l’aroma. I luppoli agrumati sono in genere evitati per l’eccessivo contrasto. Il lievito per ale può essere sia un ceppo un tipo americano pulito o una varietà inglese caratterizzante.</ingredients>
        <comparison>più amara e spesso più forte, con maggiori caratteristiche di malto scuro e più secca delle English Porter o delle Porter antecedenti il Proibizionismo. Meno forte e decisa delle American Stout.</comparison>

        <impression>solida ale scura con gusti intensi e con un’ampia gamma di equilibri gustativi e interpretazioni regionali. Possiede una maltosità torrefatta-bruciata insieme a gusti intensi di malto scuro e di frutta secca con finale dolce-amaro e caldo. Nonostante i gusti intensi, le varie componenti devono fondersi insieme per creare una birra complessa e armoniosa, non un pasticcio alcolico.</impression>
        <aroma>ricco e complesso con quantità variabili di cereali torrefatti, maltosità, esteri fruttati, luppolo e alcol. Il torrefatto ha note di caffè, cioccolato scuro/fondente o di lieve bruciato e può essere da leggero a moderatamente forte. L’aroma di malto varia da delicato a ricco, simile a quello dei Barleywine. Può avere anche lievi caratteristiche impartite dal malti speciali (tipo caramello) ma questi dovrebbero aggiungere complessità e non dominare. Gli esteri fruttati sono da bassi a moderatamente elevati, con un carattere complesso di frutta scura (susine, prugne, uvetta). L’aroma di luppolo (qualsiasi varietà) può variare da basso a parecchio aggressivo. Può inoltre essere presente aroma di alcol, ma senza essere aspro, bruciante o avere note di solvente. Le versioni invecchiate possono essere vinose o ricordare il Porto, ma mai acidule. L’equilibrio varia a seconda di quale elemento aromatico è preminente. Non è necessaria la presenza di tutti gli aromi descritti sopra, sono possibili varie interpretazioni. L’invecchiamento influenza l’intensità, l’equilibrio e l’eleganza delle sostanze aromatiche.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore variabile dal marrone-rossiccio molto scuro al nero corvino. Opaca. Schiuma da marroncino a marrone scuro, con un cappello ben formato, anche se la ritenzione varia da bassa al moderata. L’alto contenuto alcolico e la viscosità sono evidenti negli archetti lasciati sulla parete del bicchiere.</appearance>
        <flavor>ricco, profondo, complesso e spesso molto intenso con quantità variabili di cereali/malti torrefatti, maltosità, esteri fruttati, amaro e gusto di luppolo e alcol. L’amaro è da medio ad aggressivamente alto. Gusto di luppolo (di qualsiasi varietà) da medio-basso ad alto. I gusti da moderati ad aggressivamente forti di malto/cereali torrefatti possono suggerire il cioccolato dolce-amaro o fondente, il cacao e/o il caffè forte. Possono essere evidenti note di cereale leggermente bruciacchiato, di ribes nero o di catrame. Gli esteri fruttati sono da bassi a intensi con carattere di frutta scura (uvetta, susine o prugne). La struttura portante del malto può essere equilibrata o simile a quella dei Barleywine e può presentare gusti di supporto quali il caramello, il pane o il tostato. Il palato e il finale possono variare dal relativamente secco al moderatamente dolce, di solito con permanenza di torrefatto, di amaro di luppolo e di calore alcolico. L’equilibrio e l’intensità dei gusti sono influenzati dall’invecchiamento: col tempo alcuni gusti si attenuano mentre si sviluppano toni vinosi o simili a quelli del Porto.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da pieno a molto pieno con struttura vellutata, abbondante e quasi masticabile (il corpo può diminuire con una lunga maturazione). Deve essere presente e farsi notare un calore morbido e gentile impartito dall’alcol, ma questa non deve essere una caratteristica primaria: nelle versioni ben maturate l’alcol può essere nascosto. Non deve essere sciropposa o sotto-attenuata. La carbonazione varia da bassa a moderata, in relazione all’età e della maturazione.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>è tradizionalmente uno stile inglese, ma attualmente è molto più popolare e più facilmente reperibile in America dove è una delle birre artigianali preferite e non una semplice curiosità. Esistono variazioni e interpretazioni all’americana o all’inglese (prevedibilmente le versioni americane sono più amare, hanno più carattere di malto torrefatto e maggior aroma di luppolo, mentre quelle inglesi riflettono maggiormente la complessità dei malti speciali e tendono ad avere più esteri). Non tutte le Imperial Stout hanno un evidente carattere “inglese” o “americano”; tutto ciò che sta tra le due varianti è comunque accettabile e in questo caso non è opportuno segnalare una sottocategoria precisa all’iscrizione della birra a concorso. L’ampia gamma di caratteristiche a disposizione permette una massima creatività e i giudici ne devono essere consapevoli e cercare di non valutare la birra come se fosse un clone di uno specifico prodotto commerciale.</comments>
        <history>stile con una lunga, ma non necessariamente ininterrotta, storia. Le sue radici sono le robuste Porter inglesi prodotte per l’esportazione nel 1700 e si dice fossero popolari presso la corte imperiale russa. Dopo che le guerre napoleoniche interruppero il commercio, queste birre furono vendute sempre di più in Inghilterra. Col tempo questo stile sarebbe andato a scomparire, se non fosse stato ripreso dai produttori artigianali, sia in Inghilterra come revival, che negli States come re-interpretazione e re-invenzione, adattando lo stile alle caratteristiche americane.</history>

      <notes>La categoria IPA ricomprende le IPA moderne americane e le loro derivate. Ciò non implica che le IPA inglesi non siano vere e proprie IPA o che non ci sia nessuna relazione con esse. Si tratta semplicemente di un metodo per raggruppare stili simili per le competizioni. Le IPA inglesi sono raggruppate con le altre birre di origine inglese (gruppo 12C) e la Double IPA molto più alcolica è insieme alle birre americane alcoliche. Qui il termine IPA è intenzionalmente lasciato come sigla perché nessuna di queste birre storicamente è stata esportata in India e molte di esse non sono chiare (pale). Tuttavia, il termine IPA è diventato uno stile definito delle birre artigianali moderne</notes>

        <impression>una American Pale Ale decisamente luppolata e amara, moderatamente forte, che mostra i moderni luppoli americani e pacifici. L’equilibrio vira verso il luppolo, con un profilo fermentativo pulito, finale secco e malto pulito di supporto che permette di far risaltare l’elevata creatività nella luppolatura.</impression>
        <aroma> luppolo da prominente a intenso che evidenzia una o più caratteristiche dei luppoli americani o pacifici quali agrumato, floreale, balsamico, resinoso, speziato, frutta tropicale, frutta col nocciolo, frutti di bosco, melone, ecc. Molte versioni hanno il dry-hopping e offrono un aroma di luppolo fresco che è desiderabile ma non richiesto. Se è presente, l’erbaceo dovrebbe essere minimo. Come sottofondo si possono percepire aromi di cereale maltato. In alcune versioni si può percepire il fruttato proveniente dal lievito, anche se è accettabile una fermentazione neutra. Può essere presente una leggera nota alcolica, ma deve essere minima. Accettabile qualsiasi caratteristica impartita dai luppoli americani o pacifici: nuove varietà colturali continuano a essere immesse sul mercato e questo fatto non deve limitare lo stile.</aroma>
        <appearance>il colore varia da dorato medio a rosso-ambrato chiaro. Dovrebbe essere limpida, anche se le versioni non filtrate e con dry-hopping possono essere un po’ torbide. Schiuma media da bianca a color crema con buona persistenza.</appearance>
        <flavor> il luppolo varia da medio ad alto e deve riflettere le caratteristiche dei luppoli americani o pacifici, quali: agrumato, floreale, balsamico, resinoso, speziato, frutta tropicale, frutta con nocciolo, frutti di bosco, melone, ecc. Amaro da medio-alto a molto elevato. Il gusto di malto dovrebbe essere da basso a medio-basso, pulito e con note di cereale, anche se sono accettabili gusti lievi di caramello o di tostato. Basso fruttato derivante dal lievito accettabile, ma non richiesto. Finale da secco a medio-secco con dolcezza residua vicina al nullo. L’amaro e il gusto di luppolo possono permanere nel retrogusto, ma non dovrebbero essere aspri. Si può notare una leggera e delicata nota alcolica nelle versioni più forti. Può infine essere leggermente sulfurea, ma la maggior parte degli esempi non manifesta questa caratteristica.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio-leggero a medio con struttura morbida. Carbonazione da media a medio-alta. Nessuna astringenza derivata dal luppolo. Un delicato calore alcolico non è un errore, se non altera l’equilibrio generale.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>moderna interpretazione artigianale americana dello storico stile inglese, prodotta con approccio e ingredienti americani. È la base per molte moderne variazioni che comprendono la Double IPA, più alcolica, e le varie IPA con ingredienti diversi, anche se queste altre IPA dovrebbero essere inserite nello stile Speciality IPA. Il legno di quercia non è appropriato per questo stile e se si percepisce, la birra deve essere inserita nella categoria delle birre maturate in legno.</comments>
        <history>si ritiene che il primo esempio moderno di birra artigianale americana sia la Anchor Liberty Ale, prodotta per la prima volta nel 1975 con fiori di luppolo Cascade. Questo stile si è spinto oltre il primo esempio originale e ora, al confronto, assomiglia più ad una American Pale Ale americana. Le IPA americane degli esordi non erano del tutto sconosciute (si pensi alla famosa IPA della Ballantine, una birra ispirata da una vecchia ricetta inglese e maturata in botti di quercia). Questo stile tuttavia si basa sui moderni esempi artigianali.</history>
        <ingredients>come base malto Pale o distico, luppoli americani o pacifici e lievito inglese o americano con profilo pulito e lieve fruttato. In genere è una birra di tutto malto, ma ammostata a temperatura più bassa del solito per avere una attenuazione elevata. Accettabile l’aggiunta di zuccheri per migliorare l’attenuazione. L’utilizzo di malto Crystal deve essere limitato o nullo, perché grosse quantità possono dare un finale dolce che cozza con la luppolatura.</ingredients>
        <comparison>più alcolica e molto più luppolata della American Pale Ale. In confronto con la IPA inglese ha meno carattere di malto, luppolo e lievito “inglesi” (meno caramello e meno pane/tostato; più luppoli americani/pacifici e meno esteri derivati dal lievito), minor corpo e spesso un equilibrio verso il luppolato ed è, infine, leggermente più alcolica. Ha tuttavia meno alcol della Double IPA ma un equilibrio simile.</comparison>

Questa categoria permette anche delle integrazioni in futuro, quindi si potranno inserire potenziali varianti senza dover riscrivere le linee guida. L’unico elemento comune è che hanno equilibrio e impronta generale tipica dell’IPA (IPA americana), con aggiustamenti minori.</notes>
        <notes>Il termine IPA è usato come descrittore per un tipo di birra luppolata e amara. Non si deve usare il termine “India Pale Ale” nel contesto delle Specialty IPA. Storicamente nessuna di queste IPA è stata inviata in India e molte non sono chiare ma il mercato delle birre artigianali sa cosa ci si aspetta quando si parla di una IPA – quindi le varie denominazioni usate qui sotto si basano solo su quel concetto.</notes>
        <impression> riconoscibile come IPA dall’equilibrio: luppolata, amara e secca, con qualcos’altro presente che la distingue dalle altre categorie standard. Dovrebbe avere una buona bevibilità, indipendentemente dalla tipologia. I tipici errori sono una eccessiva asprezza e pesantezza, dovute al forte contrasto tra il luppolo e altri ingredienti speciali.</impression>
        <aroma>è richiesto un aroma di luppolo evidente, mentre la caratterizzazione dei luppoli dipende dal tipo specifico di Specialty IPA. Possono essere presenti altri aromi, ma quello di luppolo è tipicamente l’elemento più importante.</aroma>
        <appearance> il colore dipende dal tipo specifico di Specialty IPA. La maggior parte dovrebbe essere limpida, anche se certi stili con importanti aggiunte di sostanze amidacee o le versioni che hanno subito il dry- hopping, potrebbero essere leggermente velate. Le tipologie più scure possono essere opache, rendendo quindi irrilevante la limpidezza. Schiuma generosa e persistente con colore che dipende dal tipo specifico di Specialty IPA.</appearance>
        <flavor>il gusto di luppolo è tipicamente da medio-basso ad alto con caratteristiche che dipendono dalle varietà usate. L’amaro di luppolo è tipicamente da medio-alto a molto alto con caratteristiche che dipendono dalle varietà usate. Il gusto di malto in genere varia da basso a medio e le caratteristiche dipendono dalle varietà usate. Il finale è comunemente da medio-secco a secco. Nelle versioni più forti si può notare del gusto pulito di alcol. Infine, vari tipi di Specialty IPA possono mostrare altre caratteristiche di malto e lievito, a seconda della tipologia.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo morbido da leggero-medio a medio. Carbonazione media. Nelle versioni più forti si può percepire un leggero e delicato calore alcolico.</mouthfeel>
        <entryinstructions> il partecipante deve specificare la forza (session beer, standard, doppia); se la forza non è specificata, si presuppone sia standard. Il partecipante deve specificare il tipo di Specialty IPA dalla lista degli stili noti qui presenti o aggiornata nel sito web del BJCP. Oppure il concorrente deve descrivere il tipo di Specialty IPA e le sue caratteristiche chiave in forma di commento, in modo che i giudici sappiano cosa aspettarsi. I partecipanti devono dichiarare le varietà di luppolo usate, se ritengono che i giudici possano non riconoscere le caratteristiche varietali di nuovi luppoli. I partecipanti devono dichiarare il tipo definito di IPA (esempio Black Rye IPA) senza aggiungere altre descrizioni. I concorrenti possono usare questa categoria per una versione di birra di forza differente dalla IPA, come è definita dalla propria sottocategoria della BJCP (esempio Session-strength American o English IPA) tranne quando esiste già una sottocategoria per quello stile (ad esempio double [American] IPA).</entryinstructions>

        <impression> IPA col fruttato e lo speziato derivati dall’impiego di lievito belga. Gli esempi belgi tendono ad essere più chiari e più attenuati, simili ad una Tripel più luppolata. Ha un profilo gustativo più complesso e più maggior contenuto alcolico della tipica IPA.</impression>
        <aroma> luppolo da moderato a elevato, spesso con note tropicali, di frutta con nocciolo, agrumate o pinose tipiche delle varietà americane o pacifiche. Si possono anche trovare aromi floreali e speziati che indicano la presenza di luppoli europei. Può inoltre essere presente un aroma erbaceo dovuto al dry-hopping. Aroma delicato di malto/cereale-dolce con poco o nullo caramello. Gli esteri fruttati sono da moderati ad alti e possono includere aromi di banana, pera e mela. Si possono percepire deboli fenoli dall’aroma di chiodi di garofano e talvolta sono anche presenti aromi di zucchero candito belga.</aroma>
        <appearance> colore da dorato ad ambrato. Schiuma color crema da moderata a generosa, con buona ritenzione. Buona limpidezza ma torbida nelle versioni che hanno subito il dry-hopping.</appearance>
        <flavor>il gusto iniziale è di spezie ed esteri moderati, associati ai ceppi di lievito belga. Comuni il chiodo di garofano e pepe; tipici quelli di banana, pera e mela. Il luppolo ha una intensità da moderata ad alta e riflette le caratteristiche americane/pacifiche quali il tropicale, frutta con nocciolo, melone, agrumato o resinoso, ma anche floreale e speziato dei luppoli tipo Saaz. Il gusto di malto è lieve e cereale-dolce, talvolta con un limitato malto tostato o caramellato, anche se ciò non è espressamente richiesto. L’amaro è elevato e può essere accentuato dai gusti speziati impartiti dal lievito. Il finale varia da medio-secco a secco, anche se alcuni esempi presentano una leggera dolcezza miscelata a un amaro che permane.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio a leggero e variabile, a seconda della carbonazione e delle aggiunte. Carbonazione da media ad alta. Alcune versioni più alcoliche possono impartire un senso di calore che può non essere prontamente rilevabile.</mouthfeel>

        <impression>A beer with the dryness, hop-forward balance, and flavor characteristics of an American IPA, only darker in color - but without strongly roasted or burnt flavors. The flavor of darker malts is gentle and supportive, not a major flavor component. Drinkability is a key characteristic.</impression>
        <aroma>A moderate to high hop aroma, often with a stone fruit, tropical, citrusy, resinous, piney, berry, or melon character. If dry hopped, can have an additional floral, herbal, or grassy aroma, although this is not required. Very low to moderate dark malt aroma, which can optionally include light chocolate, coffee, or toast notes. Some clean or lightly caramelly malty sweetness may be found in the background. Fruitiness, either from esters or from hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is also acceptable.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color ranges from dark brown to black. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy; if opaque, should not be murky. Good head stand with light tan to tan color should persist.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium-low to high hop flavor with tropical, stone fruit, melon, citrusy, berry, piney or resinous aspects. Medium-high to very high hop bitterness, although dark malts may contribute to the perceived bitterness. The base malt flavor is generally clean and of low to medium intensity, and can optionally have low caramel or toffee flavors. Dark malt flavors are low to medium-low; restrained chocolate or coffee flavors may be present, but the roasted notes should not be intense, ashy, or burnt, and should not clash with the hops. Low to moderate fruitiness (from yeast or hops) is acceptable but not required. Dry to slightly off-dry finish. The finish may include a light roast character that contributes to perceived dryness, although this is not required. The bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel without significant hop- or (especially) roasted malt-derived astringency. Dry-hopped versions may be a bit resiny. Medium carbonation. A bit of creaminess may be present but is not required. Some smooth alcohol warming can and should be sensed in stronger (but not all) versions.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Most examples are standard strength. Strong examples can sometimes seem like big, hoppy porters if made too extreme, which hurts their drinkability. The hops and malt can combine to produce interesting interactions.</comments>
        <history>A variation of the American IPA style first commercially produced by Greg Noonan as Blackwatch IPA around 1990. Popularized in the Pacific Northwest and Southern California of the US starting in the early-mid 2000s. This style is sometimes known as Cascadian Dark Ale (CDA), mainly in the Pacific Northwest.</history>
        <ingredients>Debittered roast malts for color and some flavor without harshness and burnt qualities; American or New World hop varieties that don’t clash with roasted malts. Hop characteristics cited are typical of these type of hops; others characteristics are possible, particularly if derived from newer varietals.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Balance and overall impression of an American or Double IPA with restrained roast similar to the type found in Schwarzbiers. Not as roasty-burnt as American stouts and porters, and with less body and increased smoothness and drinkability.</comparison>

Retaining the dryish finish and lean body that makes IPAs so drinkable, a Brown IPA is a little more flavorful and malty than an American IPA without being sweet or heavy.</impression>
        <aroma>A moderate to moderately-strong fresh hop aroma featuring one or more characteristics of American or New World hops, such as tropical fruit, stone fruit, citrus, floral, spicy, berry, melon, pine, resinous, etc. Many versions are dry hopped and can have an additional fresh hop aroma; this is desirable but not required. Grassiness should be minimal, if present. A medium-low to medium malty-sweet aroma mixes in well with the hop selection, and often features chocolate, nuts, dark caramel, toffee, toasted bread, and/or dark fruit character. Fruitiness from yeast may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is also acceptable. A restrained alcohol note may be present, but this character should be minimal at best. Any American or New World hop character is acceptable; new hop varieties continue to be released and should not constrain this style.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color ranges from reddish-brown to dark brown but not black. Frequently opaque, but should be clear if visible. Unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy. Medium-sized, cream-colored to tan head with good persistence.</appearance>
        <flavor>Hop flavor is medium to high, and should reflect an American or New World hop character, such as citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Medium-high to high hop bitterness. Malt flavor should be medium-low to medium, and is generally clean but malty-sweet up front with milk chocolate, cocoa, toffee, nutty, biscuity, dark caramel, toasted bread and/or dark fruit malt flavors. The character malt choices and the hop selections should complement and enhance each other, not clash. The level of malt flavor should nearly balance the hop bitterness and flavor presentation. Low yeast-derived fruitiness is acceptable but not required. Dry to medium finish; residual sweetness should be medium-low to none. The bitterness and hop flavor may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. A very light, clean alcohol flavor may be noted in stronger versions. No roasted, burnt, or harsh-bitter malt character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harsh hop-derived astringency. Very light, smooth alcohol warming not a fault if it does not intrude into overall balance.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Previously might have been a sub-genre of American Brown Ales, hoppier and stronger than the normal products, but still maintaining the essential drinkability by avoiding sweet flavors or a heavy body or finish. The hops and malt can combine to produce interesting interactions.</comments>
        <history>A more modern craft beer name for a style that has long been popular with US homebrewers, when it was known as a hoppier American Brown Ale or sometimes Texas Brown Ale (despite origins in California).</history>
        <ingredients>Similar to an American IPA, but with medium or dark crystal malts, lightly roasted chocolate-type malts, or other intermediate color character malts. May use sugar adjuncts, including brown sugar. American or New World finishing hops with tropical, fruity, citrusy, piney, berry, or melon aspects; the choice of hops and character malts is synergistic - they very much have to complement each other and not clash.</ingredients>

        <comparison>Similar to the difference between an American Amber Ale and an American Pale Ale, a Red IPA will differ from an American IPA with the addition of some darker crystal malts giving a slightly sweeter, more caramelly and dark fruit-based balance. A Red IPA differs from an American Strong Ale in that the malt profile is less intense and there is less body; a Red IPA still has an IPA balance and doesn’t trend towards a barleywine-like malt character. A Red IPA is like a stronger, hoppier American Amber Ale, with the characteristic dry finish, medium-light body, and strong late hop character.</comparison>

        <comments>A modern American craft beer variation of American IPA. Rye malt character should be noticeable, otherwise enter in American IPA. Oak is inappropriate in this style; if noticeably oaked, enter in wood-aged category.</comments>
        <history>Looking to add complexity and variety to their IPAs, craft brewers and homebrewers substituted rye malt for a portion of their base malt. Rye IPAs, RyePAs or RIPAs have found a place in many craft breweries seasonal rotations.</history>
        <ingredients>Pale ale or 2-row brewers malt as the base, 15-20% Rye malt, American or New World hops, American or English yeast with a clean or slightly fruity profile. Generally all-malt, but mashed at lower temperatures for high attenuation. Sugar additions to aid attenuation are acceptable. Water character varies from soft to moderately sulfate. Restrained use of crystal malts, if any, as high amounts can lead to a sweet finish and clash with the hop character.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Drier and slightly spicier than an American IPA. Bitterness and spiciness from rye lingers longer than an American IPA. Does not have the intense rye malt character of a Roggenbier. Some examples are stronger like a Double IPA.</comparison>

        <impression>A fruity, spicy, refreshing version of an American IPA, but with a lighter color, less body, and featuring either the distinctive yeast and/or spice additions typical of a Belgian witbier.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate fruity esters - banana, citrus, perhaps apricot. May have light to moderate spice aroma such as coriander or pepper from actual spice additions and/or Belgian yeast. Hop aroma is moderately-low to medium, usually American or New World type with stone fruit, citrus and tropical aromas. Esters and spices may reduce hop aroma perception. Light clove-like phenolics may be present.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale to deep golden color, typically hazy. Moderate to large, dense white head that persists.</appearance>
        <flavor>Light malt flavor, perhaps a bit bready. Fruity esters are moderate to high, with citrus flavors similar to grapefruit and orange, or stone fruit like apricot. Sometimes banana-like flavors are present. Hop flavor is medium-low to medium-high with citrusy or fruity aspects. Some spicy clove-like flavors from Belgian yeast may be present. Coriander and orange peel flavors may be found as well. Bitterness is high which leads to a moderately dry, refreshing finish.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light body with medium to medium-high carbonation. Typically no astringency, although highly spiced examples may exhibit a light astringency which is not distracting.</mouthfeel>

      <name>Strong American Ale</name>
      <notes>This category includes modern American strong ales with a varying balance of malt and hops. The category is defined mostly by alcohol strength and a lack of roast.</notes>
      <subcategory id="22A">
        <name>Double IPA</name>
        <impression>An intensely hoppy, fairly strong pale ale without the big, rich, complex maltiness and residual sweetness and body of an American barleywine. Strongly hopped, but clean, dry, and lacking harshness. Drinkability is an important characteristic; this should not be a heavy, sipping beer.</impression>
        <aroma>A prominent to intense hop aroma that typically showcases American or New World hop characteristics (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). Most versions are dry hopped and can have an additional resinous or grassy aroma, although this is not absolutely required. Some clean malty sweetness may be found in the background. Fruitiness, either from esters or hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is typical. Some alcohol can usually be noted, but it should not have a “hot” character.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color ranges from golden to light orange-copper; most modern versions are fairly pale. Good clarity, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy. Moderate-sized, persistent, white to off-white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Hop flavor is strong and complex, and can reflect the characteristics of modern American or New World hop varieties (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). High to absurdly high hop bitterness. Low to medium malt flavor, generally clean and grainy-malty although low levels of caramel or toasty flavors are acceptable. Low to medium fruitiness is acceptable but not required. A long, lingering bitterness is usually present in the aftertaste but should not be harsh. Dry to medium-dry finish; should not finish sweet or heavy. A light, clean, smooth alcohol flavor is not a fault. Oak is inappropriate in this style. May be slightly sulfury, but most examples do not exhibit this character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harsh hop-derived astringency. Restrained, smooth alcohol warming acceptable.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A showcase for hops, yet remaining quite drinkable. The adjective “double" is arbitrary and simply implies a stronger version of an IPA; “imperial,” “extra,” “extreme,” or any other variety of adjectives would be equally valid, although the modern American market seems to have now coalesced around the “double” term.</comments>
        <history>An American craft beer innovation first developed in the mid-late 1990s reflecting the trend of American craft brewers “pushing the envelope” to satisfy the need of hop aficionados for increasingly intense products. Became more mainstream and popular throughout the 2000s, and inspired additional IPA creativity.</history>
        <ingredients>Clean 2-row malt is typical as a base grain; an excessively complex grist can be distracting. Crystal-type malts often muddy the hop flavors, and are generally considered undesirable in significant quantities. Sugar or other highly fermentable adjuncts are often used to increase attenuation, as are lower-temperature mash rests. Can use a complex variety of hops, typically American or New World, often with cutting-edge profiles providing distinctive differences. Modern hops with unusual characteristics are not out of style. American yeast that can give a clean or slightly fruity profile.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Bigger than either an English or American IPA in both alcohol strength and overall hop level (bittering and finish). Less malty, lower body, less rich and a greater overall hop intensity than an American Barleywine. Typically not as high in gravity/alcohol as a barleywine, since high alcohol and malt tend to limit drinkability.</comparison>

        <name>American Strong Ale</name>
        <impression>A strong, full-flavored American ale that challenges and rewards the palate with full malty and hoppy flavors and substantial bitterness. The flavors are bold but complementary, and are stronger and richer than average-strength pale and amber American ales.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium to high hop aroma, most often presenting citrusy or resiny notes although characteristics associated with other American or New World varieties may be found (tropical, stone fruit, melon, etc.). Moderate to bold maltiness supports hop profile, with medium to dark caramel a common presence, bready or toasty possible and background notes of light roast and/or chocolate noticeable in some examples. Generally exhibits clean to moderately fruity ester profile. Moderate alcohol aromatics may be noticeable, but should not be hot, harsh, or solventy.</aroma>
        <appearance>Medium amber to deep copper or light brown. Moderate-low to medium-sized off-white to light tan head; may have low head retention. Good clarity. Alcohol level and viscosity may present “legs” when glass is swirled.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium to high dextrinous malt with a full range of caramel, toffee, dark fruit flavors. Low to medium toasty, bready, or Maillard-rich malty flavors are optional, and can add complexity. Medium-high to high hop bitterness. The malt gives a medium to high sweet impression on the palate, although the finish may be slightly sweet to somewhat dry. Moderate to high hop flavor. Low to moderate fruity esters. The hop flavors are similar to the aroma (citrusy, resiny, tropical, stone fruit, melon, etc.). Alcohol presence may be noticeable, but sharp or solventy alcohol flavors are undesirable. Roasted malt flavors are allowable but should be a background note; burnt malt flavors are inappropriate. While strongly malty on the palate, the finish should seem bitter to bittersweet. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. The aftertaste typically has malt, hops, and alcohol noticeable.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to full body. An alcohol warmth may be present, but not be excessively hot. Any astringency present should be attributable to bold hop bitterness and should not be objectionable on the palate. Medium-low to medium carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A fairly broad style that can describe beers labeled in various ways, including modern Double/Imperial Red/Amber Ales and other strong, malty-but-hoppy beers that aren’t quite in the Barleywine class. Diverse enough to include what may be viewed as a strong American Amber Ale with room for more interpretations of other “Imperial” versions of lower gravity American Ale styles. Many “East Coast” type IPAs might fit better in this category if they have considerable crystal malt or otherwise more of a malty-sweet finish.</comments>
        <history>While modern craft versions were developed as “imperial” strength versions of American amber or red ales, the style has much in common with historic American stock ales. Strong, malty beers were highly hopped to keep as provision beers prior to prohibition. There is no continuous legacy of brewing stock ales in this manner, but the resemblance is considerable. Stone Arrogant Bastard was born out of a batch of pale ale that was mistakenly made with excess ingredients, thus creating what may have been the prototype for the imperial amber/red ale. Great Lakes first brewed Nosferatu in the early 1990s and called it a stock ale, although they now call it an imperial red ale. So whether by direct historical inspiration or by accident, the style developed independently in the craft beer era and has subsequently become quite popular.</history>
        <ingredients>Well-modified pale malt as a base; some character malts would be appropriate, medium to dark crystal malts are typical. Citrusy or piney American hops are common, although any American or New World varieties can be used in quantity, provided they do not clash with the malt character. Generally uses an attenuative American yeast.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Generally not as strong and as rich as an American Barleywine. More malt balanced than an American or Double IPA with more American hop intensity than an English Strong Ale style would tolerate.</comparison>

        <name>American Barleywine</name>
        <impression>A well-hopped American interpretation of the richest and strongest of the English ales. The hop character should be evident throughout, but does not have to be unbalanced. The alcohol strength and hop bitterness often combine to leave a very long finish.</impression>
        <aroma>Hop character moderate to assertive and often showcases citrusy, fruity, or resiny New World varieties (although other varieties, such as floral, earthy or spicy English varieties or a blend of varieties, may be used). Rich maltiness, with a character that may be sweet, caramelly, bready, or fairly neutral. Low to moderately-strong fruity esters and alcohol aromatics. However, the intensity of aromatics often subsides with age. Hops tend to be nearly equal to malt in the aroma, with alcohol and esters far behind.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color may range from light amber to medium copper; may rarely be as dark as light brown. Often has ruby highlights. Moderately-low to large off-white to light tan head; may have low head retention. May be cloudy with chill haze at cooler temperatures, but generally clears to good to brilliant clarity as it warms. The color may appear to have great depth, as if viewed through a thick glass lens. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in “legs” when beer is swirled in a glass.</appearance>
        <flavor>Strong, rich malt flavor with a noticeable hop flavor and bitterness in the balance. Moderately-low to moderately-high malty sweetness on the palate, although the finish may be somewhat sweet to quite dry (depending on aging). Hop bitterness may range from moderately strong to aggressive. While strongly malty, the balance should always seem bitter. Moderate to high hop flavor (any variety, but often showing a range of New World hop characteristics). Low to moderate fruity esters. Noticeable alcohol presence, but well-integrated. Flavors will smooth out and decline over time, but any oxidized character should be muted (and generally be masked by the hop character). May have some bready or caramelly malt flavors, but these should not be high; roasted or burnt malt flavors are inappropriate.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although the body may decline with long conditioning). Alcohol warmth should be noticeable but smooth. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Sometimes known as “Barley Wine” or “Barleywine style ale” (the latter due to legal requirements, not brewery preference).</comments>
        <history>Usually the strongest ale offered by a brewery, often associated with the winter or holiday season and vintage-dated. As with many American craft beer styles, derived from English examples but using American ingredients and featuring a much more forward hop profile. One of the first American craft beer versions was Anchor Old Foghorn, first brewed in 1975. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, first brewed in 1983, set the standard for the hop-forward style of today. The story goes that when Sierra Nevada first sent Bigfoot out for lab analysis, the lab called and said, “your barleywine is too bitter” - to which Sierra Nevada replied, “thank you.”</history>
        <ingredients>Well-modified pale malt should form the backbone of the grist. Some specialty or character malts may be used. Dark malts should be used with great restraint, if at all, as most of the color arises from a lengthy boil. New World hops are common, although any varieties can be used in quantity. Generally uses an attenuative American ale yeast.</ingredients>
        <comparison>The American version of the Barleywine tends to have a greater emphasis on hop bitterness, flavor and aroma than the English Barleywine, and often features American hop varieties. Typically paler than the darker English Barleywines (and lacking in the deeper malt flavors) but darker than the golden English Barleywines. Differs from a Double IPA in that the hops are not extreme, the malt is more forward, and the body is fuller and often richer. An American Barleywine typically has more residual sweetness than a Double IPA, which affects the overall drinkability (sipping vs. drinking).</comparison>

        <impression>A richly textured, high alcohol sipping beer with a significant grainy, bready flavor and sleek body. The emphasis is first on the bready, wheaty flavors with interesting complexity from malt, hops, fruity yeast character and alcohol complexity.</impression>
        <aroma>Hop aroma is mild and can represent just about any late hop aromatic. Moderate to moderately-strong bready, wheaty malt character, often with additional malt complexity such as honey and caramel. A light, clean, alcohol aroma may noted. Low to medium fruity notes may be apparent. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable but not required. Weizen yeast character (banana/clove) is inappropriate.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color ranges from gold to deep amber, often with garnet or ruby highlights. Low to medium off-white head. The head may have creamy texture, and good retention. Chill haze is allowable, but usually clears up as the beer gets warmer. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in “legs” when beer is swirled in a glass.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderate to moderately-high wheaty malt flavor, dominant in the flavor balance over any hop character. Low to moderate bready, toasty, caramel, or honey malt notes are a welcome complexity note, although not required. Hop flavor is low to medium, and can reflect any variety. Moderate to moderately-high fruitiness, often with a dried-fruit character. Hop bitterness may range from low to moderate; balance therefore ranges from malty to evenly balanced. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. Some oxidative or vinous flavors may be present, as are light alcohol notes that are clean and smooth but complex. A complementary, supportive oak character is welcome, but not required.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-full to full bodied and chewy, often with a luscious, velvety texture. Low to moderate carbonation. Light to moderate smooth alcohol warming may also be present.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Dark malts should be used with restraint. Much of the color arises from a lengthy boil. Some commercial examples may be larger than the Vital Statistics, and some may not be brewed every year.</comments>
        <history>A relatively recent American craft beer style that was first brewed at the Rubicon Brewing Company in 1988. Often a winter seasonal, vintage, or one-off release. Breweries frequently experiment with this style, leading to a range of interpretations.</history>
        <ingredients>Typically brewed with a combination of American two-row and American wheat. Style commonly uses 50% or more wheat malt. Any variety of hops may be used. May be oak-aged.</ingredients>
        <comparison>More than simply a wheat-based barleywine, many versions have very expressive fruity and hoppy notes, while others develop complexity through oak aging. Less emphasis on the hops than American Barleywine. Has roots in American Wheat Beer rather than any German wheat styles, so should not have any German weizen yeast character.</comparison>

      <name>European Sour Ale</name>
      <notes>This category contains the traditional sour beer styles of Europe that are still produced, many (but not all) with a wheat component. Most have low bitterness, with the sourness of the beer providing the balance that hop bitterness would otherwise contribute. Some are sweetened or flavored, whether at the brewery or upon consumption.</notes>

        <name>Berliner Weisse</name>
        <impression>A very pale, refreshing, low-alcohol German wheat beer with a clean lactic sourness and a very high carbonation level. A light bread dough malt flavor supports the sourness, which shouldn’t seem artificial. Any <em>Brettanomyces</em> funk is restrained.</impression>
        <aroma>A sharply sour character is dominant (moderate to moderately-high). Can have up to a moderately fruity character (often lemony or tart apple). The fruitiness may increase with age and a light flowery character may develop. No hop aroma. The wheat may present as uncooked bread dough in fresher versions; combined with the acidity, may suggest sourdough bread. May optionally have a restrained funky <em>Brettanomyces</em> character.</aroma>
        <appearance>Very pale straw in color. Clarity ranges from clear to somewhat hazy. Large, dense, white head with poor retention. Always effervescent.</appearance>
        <flavor>Clean lactic sourness dominates and can be quite strong. Some complementary doughy, bready or grainy wheat flavor is generally noticeable. Hop bitterness is undetectable; sourness provides the balance rather than hops. Never vinegary. A restrained citrusy-lemony or tart apple fruitiness may be detected. Very dry finish. Balance dominated by sourness, but some malt flavor should be present. No hop flavor. May optionally have a restrained funky <em>Brettanomyces</em> character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light body. Very high carbonation. No sensation of alcohol. Crisp, juicy acidity.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>In Germany, it is classified as a <em>Schankbier</em> denoting a small beer of starting gravity in the range 7-8 °P. Often served with the addition of a shot of sugar syrups <em>(mit schuss)</em> flavored with raspberry <em>(himbeer)</em>, woodruff <em>(waldmeister)</em>, or Caraway schnapps <em>(Kümmel)</em> to counter the substantial sourness. Has been described by some as the most purely refreshing beer in the world.</comments>
        <history>A regional specialty of Berlin; referred to by Napoleon's troops in 1809 as “the Champagne of the North” due to its lively and elegant character. At one point, it was smoked and there used to be Märzen-strength (14 °P) version. Increasingly rare in German, but some American craft breweries now regularly produce the style.</history>
        <ingredients>Wheat malt content is typically 50% of the grist (as is tradition with all German wheat beers) with the remainder typically being Pilsner malt. A symbiotic fermentation with top-fermenting yeast and <em>Lactobacillus</em> (various strains) provides the sharp sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during fermentation and by extended cool aging. Hop bitterness is non-existent. Decoction mashing with mash hopping is traditional. German brewing scientists believe that <em>Brettanomyces</em> is essential to get the correct flavor profile, but this character is never strong.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Compared to a lambic, is generally not as acidic and has a clean lactic sourness with restrained to below sensory threshold funk. Also lower in alcohol content.</comparison>

        <name>Flanders Red Ale</name>
        <impression>A sour, fruity, red wine-like Belgian-style ale with interesting supportive malt flavors and fruit complexity. The dry finish and tannin completes the mental image of a fine red wine.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex fruity-sour profile with supporting malt that often gives a wine-like impression. Fruitiness is high, and reminiscent of black cherries, oranges, plums or red currants. There are often low to medium-low vanilla and/or chocolate notes. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. The sour aroma ranges from balanced to intense. Prominent vinegary acetic character is inappropriate. No hop aroma. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep red, burgundy to reddish-brown in color. Good clarity. White to very pale tan head. Average to good head retention.</appearance>
        <flavor>Intense fruitiness commonly includes plum, orange, black cherry or red currant flavors. A mild vanilla and/or chocolate character is often present. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. Sour flavor ranges from complementary to intense, and can have an acidic bite. Malty flavors range from complementary to prominent, and often have a soft toasty-rich quality. Generally as the sour character increases, the malt character blends to more of a background flavor (and vice versa). No hop flavor. Restrained hop bitterness. An acidic, tannic bitterness is often present in low to moderate amounts, and adds an aged red wine-like character and finish. Prominent vinegary acetic character is inappropriate. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary flavor. Balanced to the malt side, but dominated by the fruity, sour, wine-like impression.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium bodied. Low to medium carbonation. Low to medium astringency, like a well-aged red wine, often with a prickly acidity. Deceivingly light and crisp on the palate although a somewhat sweet finish is not uncommon.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Long aging and blending of young and well-aged beer often occurs, adding to the smoothness and complexity, though the aged product is sometimes released as a connoisseur’s beer. Known as the Burgundy of Belgium, it is more wine-like than any other beer style. The reddish color is a product of the malt although an extended, less-than-rolling portion of the boil may help add an attractive Burgundy hue. Aging will also darken the beer. The Flanders red is more acetic (but never vinegar-like) and the fruity flavors more reminiscent of a red wine than an Oud Bruin. Can have an apparent attenuation of up to 98%.</comments>
        <history>An indigenous beer of West Flanders, typified by the products of the Rodenbach brewery, established in 1820 in West Flanders but reflective of earlier brewing traditions. The beer is aged for up to two years, often in huge oaken barrels which contain the resident bacteria necessary to sour the beer. It was once common in Belgium and England to blend old beer with young to balance the sourness and acidity found in aged beer. While blending of batches for consistency is now common among larger breweries, this type of blending is a fading art.</history>
        <ingredients>A base of Vienna and/or Munich malts, light to medium cara-malts, and a small amount of Special B are used with up to 20% maize. Low alpha acid continental hops are commonly used (avoid high alpha or distinctive American hops). Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus and Brettanomyces (and acetobacter) contribute to the fermentation and eventual flavor.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Less malty-rich than an Oud Bruin, often with more of a fruity-tart profile.</comparison>

        <impression>A malty, fruity, aged, somewhat sour Belgian-style brown ale.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex combination of fruity esters and rich malt character. Medium to medium-high esters commonly reminiscent of raisins, plums, figs, dates, black cherries or prunes. Medium low to medium high malt character of caramel, toffee, orange, treacle or chocolate. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. A sherry-like character may be present and generally denotes an aged example. A low sour aroma may be present, and can modestly increase with age but should not grow to a noticeable acetic/vinegary character. Hop aroma absent. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Dark reddish-brown to brown in color. Good clarity. Average to good head retention. Ivory to light tan head color.</appearance>
        <flavor>Malty with fruity complexity and typically some caramel character. Medium to medium-high fruitiness commonly includes dark or dried fruit such as raisins, plums, figs, dates, black cherries or prunes. Medium low to medium high malt character of caramel, toffee, orange, treacle or chocolate. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. A slight sourness often becomes more pronounced in well-aged examples, along with some sherry-like character, producing a “sweet-and-sour” profile. The sourness should not grow to a notable acetic/vinegary character. Hop flavor absent. Restrained hop bitterness. Low oxidation is appropriate as a point of complexity. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary flavor. Balance is malty, but with fruitiness and sourness present. Sweet and tart finish</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-full body. Low to moderate carbonation. No astringency.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Long aging and blending of young and aged beer may occur, adding smoothness and complexity and balancing any harsh, sour character. This style was designed to lay down so examples with a moderate aged character are considered superior to younger examples. As in fruit lambics, Oud Bruin can be used as a base for fruit-flavored beers such as <em>kriek</em> (cherries) or <em>frambozen</em> (raspberries), though these should be entered in the <em>Classic-Style Fruit Beer</em> category.</comments>
        <history>An “old ale” tradition, indigenous to East Flanders, typified by the products of the Liefman brewery (now owned by Riva), which has roots back to the 1600s. Historically brewed as a “provision beer” that would develop some sourness as it aged. These beers were typically more sour than current commercial examples. While Flanders red beers are aged in oak, the brown beers are warm aged in stainless steel.</history>
        <ingredients>A base of Pils malt with judicious amounts of dark cara malts and a tiny bit of black or roast malt. Often includes maize. Low alpha acid continental hops are typical (avoid high alpha or distinctive American hops). Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus (and acetobacter) contribute to the fermentation and eventual flavor. Lactobacillus reacts poorly to elevated levels of alcohol. Water high in carbonates is typical of its home region and will buffer the acidity of darker malts and the lactic sourness. Magnesium in the water accentuates the sourness.</ingredients>
        <comparison>A deeper malt character distinguishes these beers from Flanders red ales. The Oud Bruin is less acetic and maltier than a Flanders Red, and the fruity flavors are more malt-oriented.</comparison>

        <name>Lambic</name>
        <impression>A fairly sour, often moderately funky wild Belgian wheat beer with sourness taking the place of hop bitterness in the balance. Traditionally spontaneously fermented in the Brussels area and served uncarbonated, the refreshing acidity makes for a very pleasant café drink.</impression>
        <aroma>A decidedly sour aroma is often dominant in young examples, but may become more subdued with age as it blends with aromas described as barnyard, earthy, goaty, hay, horsey, and horse blanket. A mild citrus-fruity aroma is considered favorable. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is unfavorable. Older versions are commonly fruity with aromas of apples or even honey. No hop aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale yellow to deep golden in color; age tends to darken the beer. Clarity is hazy to good. Younger versions are often cloudy, while older ones are generally clear. White colored head generally has poor retention.</appearance>
        <flavor>Young examples are often noticeably lactic-sour, but aging can bring this character more in balance with the malt, wheat and barnyard characteristics. Fruity flavors are simpler in young lambics and more complex in the older examples, where they are reminiscent of apples or other light fruits, rhubarb, or honey. Some citrus flavor (often grapefruit) is occasionally noticeable, and is desirable. The malt and wheat character are typically low with some bready-grainy notes. An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is low to none, and generally undetectable; sourness provides the balance. Typically has a dry finish. No hop flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the many mouth-filling flavors prevent the beer from feeling like water. As a rule of thumb, lambic dries with age, which makes dryness a reasonable indicator of age. Has a medium to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Traditional versions are virtually to completely uncarbonated, but bottled examples can pick up moderate carbonation with age.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Straight lambics are single-batch, unblended beers. Since they are unblended, the straight lambic is often a true product of the “house character” of a brewery and will be more variable than a gueuze. They are generally served young (6 months) and on tap as cheap, easy-drinking beers without any filling carbonation. Younger versions tend to be one-dimensionally sour since a complex Brett character often takes upwards of a year to develop. An enteric character is often indicative of a lambic that is too young. A noticeable vinegary or cidery character is considered a fault by Belgian brewers. Since the wild yeast and bacteria will ferment ALL sugars, they are typically bottled only when they have completely fermented.</comments>
        <history>Spontaneously fermented wild ales from the area in and around Brussels (the Senne Valley) stem from a farmhouse brewing tradition several centuries old. The number of producers is constantly dwindling.</history>
        <ingredients>Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged hops (3 years) are used. The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than bitterness, and makes actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditionally these beers are spontaneously fermented with naturally occurring yeast and bacteria in predominately oaken barrels. The barrels used are neutral with little oak character, so don’t expect a fresh or forward oak character - more neutral is typical. Home-brewed and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast commonly including <em>Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus</em> and <em>Lactobacillus</em> in an attempt to recreate the effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and the surrounding countryside of the Senne River valley. Cultures taken from bottles are sometimes used but there is no simple way of knowing what organisms are still viable.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Generally has a more simple sourness and complexity than a gueuze. Traditionally served uncarbonated from pitchers, while gueuze is bottled and very highly carbonated.</comparison>
        <examples>The only bottled version readily available is Cantillon Grand Cru Bruocsella of whatever single batch vintage the brewer deems worthy to bottle. De Cam sometimes bottles their very old (5 years) lambic. In and around Brussels there are specialty cafes that often have draught lambics from traditional brewers or blenders such as Boon, De Cam, Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, Lindemans, Timmermans and Girardin.</examples>

        <name>Gueuze</name>
        <impression>A complex, pleasantly sour but balanced wild Belgian wheat beer that is highly carbonated and very refreshing. The spontaneous fermentation character can provide a very interesting complexity, with a wide range of wild barnyard, horse blanket, or leather characteristics intermingling with citrusy-fruity flavors and acidity.</impression>
        <aroma>A moderately sour aroma blends with aromas described as barnyard, leather, earthy, goaty, hay, horsey, and horse blanket. While some may be more dominantly sour, balance is the key and denotes a better gueuze. Commonly fruity with aromas of citrus fruits (often grapefruit), apples or other light fruits, rhubarb, or honey. A very mild oak aroma is considered favorable. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is unfavorable. No hop aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Golden color, with excellent clarity and a thick, rocky, mousse-like, white head that seems to last forever. Always effervescent.</appearance>
        <flavor>A moderately sour character is classically in balance with the malt, wheat and barnyard characteristics. A low, complementary sweetness may be present but higher levels are not traditional. While some may be more dominantly sour, balance is the key and denotes a better gueuze. A varied fruit flavor is common, and can have a honey-like character. A mild vanilla and/or oak flavor is occasionally noticeable. The malt is generally low and bready-grainy. An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is generally absent but a very low hop bitterness may occasionally be perceived; sourness provides most of the balance. Crisp, dry, and tart finish. No hop flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the many mouth-filling flavors prevent the beer from feeling like water. Has a low to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Some versions have a light warming character. Highly carbonated.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Gueuze is traditionally produced by mixing one, two, and three-year old lambic. “Young” lambic contains fermentable sugars while old lambic has the characteristic “wild” taste of the Senne River valley. A noticeable vinegary or cidery character is considered a fault by Belgian brewers. A good gueuze is not the most pungent, but possesses a full and tantalizing bouquet, a sharp aroma, and a soft, velvety flavor. Lambic is served uncarbonated, while gueuze is served effervescent. Products marked <em>oude</em> or <em>ville</em> are considered most traditional.</comments>
        <history>Spontaneously fermented wild ales from the area in and around Brussels (the Senne Valley) stem from a farmhouse brewing and blending tradition several centuries old. The number of producers is constantly dwindling and some producers are untraditionally sweetening their products (post-fermentation) to make them more palatable to a wider audience. These guidelines describe the traditional dry product.</history>

        <name>Fruit Lambic</name>
        <impression>A complex, fruity, pleasantly sour, wild wheat ale fermented by a variety of Belgian microbiota, and showcasing the fruit contributions blended with the wild character. The type of fruit can sometimes be hard to identify as fermented and aged fruit characteristics can seem different from the more recognizable fresh fruit aromas and flavors.</impression>
        <aroma>The specified fruit should be the dominant aroma. A low to moderately sour character blends with aromas described as barnyard, earthy, goaty, hay, horsey, and horse blanket (and thus should be recognizable as a lambic). The fruit aroma commonly blends well with the other aromas. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is unfavorable. No hop aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>The variety of fruit generally determines the color, although lighter-colored fruit may have little effect on the color. The color intensity may fade with age. Clarity is often good, although some fruit will not drop bright. A thick rocky, mousse-like head, sometimes a shade of fruit, is generally long-lasting (carbonation-dependent). Carbonation is typically high, but must be specified.</appearance>
        <flavor>The specified fruit should be evident. Low to moderately sour flavor, often with an acidic bite in the finish. The classic barnyard characteristics may be low to high. When young, the beer will present its full fruity taste. As it ages, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit character—thus fruit lambics are not intended for long aging. The finish is commonly dry and tart, but a low, complementary sweetness may be present; higher sweetness levels are not traditional but can be included for personal preference (sweetness level must be specified). A mild vanilla and/or oak flavor is occasionally noticeable. An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is generally absent; acidity provides the balance. No hop flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the many mouth-filling flavors prevent the beer from tasting like water. Has a low to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Some versions have a light warming character. Carbonation can vary from sparkling to nearly still (must be specified).</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Fruit-based lambics are often produced like gueuze by mixing one, two, and three-year old lambic. “Young” lambic contains fermentable sugars while old lambic has the characteristic “wild” taste of the Senne River valley. Fruit is commonly added halfway through aging and the yeast and bacteria will ferment all sugars from the fruit. Fruit may also be added to unblended lambic. The most traditional styles of fruit lambics include <em>kriek</em> (cherries), <em>framboise</em> (raspberries) and <em>druivenlambik</em> (muscat grapes). IBUs are approximate since aged hops are used; Belgians use hops for anti-bacterial properties more than bittering in lambics.</comments>
        <history>Spontaneously fermented wild ales from the area in and around Brussels (the Senne Valley) stem from a farmhouse brewing and blending tradition several centuries old. The number of producers is constantly dwindling and some are untraditionally sweetening their products (post-fermentation) with sugar or sweet fruit to make them more palatable to a wider audience. Fruit was traditionally added to lambic or gueuze, either by the blender or publican, to increase the variety of beers available in local cafes.</history>
        <ingredients>Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged hops (3 years) are used. The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than bitterness, and makes actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditional products use 10-30% fruit (25%, if cherry). Fruits traditionally used include tart cherries (with pits), raspberries or Muscat grapes. More recent examples include peaches, apricots or merlot grapes. Tart or acidic fruit is traditionally used as its purpose is not to sweeten the beer but to add a new dimension. Traditionally these beers are spontaneously fermented with naturally occurring yeast and bacteria in predominately oaken barrels. The barrels used are old and have little oak character, so don’t expect a fresh or forward oak character - more neutral is typical. Home-brewed and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast commonly including Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus in an attempt to recreate the effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and the surrounding countryside of the Senne River valley.

        <aroma>Moderate malty sweetness (often with light notes of honey and/or vanilla) with light, grainy, spicy wheat aromatics, often with a bit of tartness. Moderate perfumy coriander, often with a complex herbal, spicy, or peppery note in the background. Moderate zesty, citrusy-orangey fruitiness. A low spicy-herbal hop aroma is optional, but should never overpower the other characteristics. Vegetal, celery-like, or ham-like aromas are inappropriate. Spices should blend in with fruity, floral and sweet aromas and should not be overly strong.</aroma>
        <appearance>Very pale straw to very light gold in color. The beer will be very cloudy from starch haze and/or yeast, which gives it a milky, whitish-yellow appearance. Dense, white, moussy head. Head retention should be quite good.</appearance>
        <flavor>Pleasant malty-sweet grain flavor (often with a honey and/or vanilla character) and a zesty, orange-citrusy fruitiness. Refreshingly crisp with a dry, often tart, finish. Can have a low bready wheat flavor. Optionally has a very light lactic-tasting sourness. Herbal-spicy flavors, which may include coriander and other spices, are common should be subtle and balanced, not overpowering. A spicy-earthy hop flavor is low to none, and if noticeable, never gets in the way of the spices. Hop bitterness is low to medium-low, and doesn’t interfere with refreshing flavors of fruit and spice, nor does it persist into the finish. Bitterness from orange pith should not be present. Vegetal, celery-like, ham-like, or soapy flavors are inappropriate.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, often having a smoothness and light creaminess from unmalted wheat and the occasional oats. Despite body and creaminess, finishes dry and often a bit tart. Effervescent character from high carbonation. Refreshing, from carbonation, light acidity, and lack of bitterness in finish. No harshness or astringency from orange pith. Should not be overly dry and thin, nor should it be thick and heavy.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The presence, character and degree of spicing and lactic sourness varies. Overly spiced and/or sour beers are not good examples of the style. Coriander of certain origins might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer tends to be fragile and does not age well, so younger, fresher, properly handled examples are most desirable. Most examples seem to be approximately 5% ABV.</comments>
        <history>A 400-year-old Belgian beer style that died out in the 1950s; it was later revived by Pierre Celis at Hoegaarden, and has grown steadily in popularity over time, both with modern craft brewers and mass-market producers who see it as a somewhat fruity summer seasonal beer.</history>
        <ingredients>About 50% unmalted wheat and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt) constitute the grist. In some versions, up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices of freshly-ground coriander and Curaçao or sometimes sweet orange peel complement the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g., chamomile, cumin, cinnamon, Grains of Paradise) may be used for complexity but are much less prominent. Ale yeast prone to the production of mild, spicy flavors is very characteristic. In some instances a very limited lactic fermentation, or the actual addition of lactic acid, is done.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Low bitterness level with a balance similar to a Weissbier, but with spice and citrus character coming from additions rather than the yeast.</comparison>

        <name>Belgian Pale Ale</name>
        <impression>A moderately malty, somewhat fruity, easy-drinking, copper-colored Belgian ale that is somewhat less aggressive in flavor profile than many other Belgian beers. The malt character tends to be a bit biscuity with light toasty, honey-like, or caramelly components; the fruit character is noticeable and complementary to the malt. The bitterness level is generally moderate, but may not seem as high due to the flavorful malt profile.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate malt aroma, which can be a combination of toasty, biscuity, or nutty, possibly with a touch of light caramel or honey. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness with an orange- or pear-like character. Low to moderate strength hop character (spicy, herbal, or floral) optionally blended with background level peppery, spicy phenols. The hop character is lower in balance than the malt and fruitiness.</aroma>
        <appearance>Amber to copper in color. Clarity is very good. Creamy, rocky, white head often fades more quickly than other Belgian beers.</appearance>
        <flavor>Has an initial soft, smooth, moderately malty flavor with a variable profile of toasty, biscuity, nutty, light caramel and/or honey notes. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness, sometimes orange- or pear-like. Relatively light (medium-low to low) spicy, herbal, or floral hop character. The hop bitterness is medium-high to medium-low, and is optionally enhanced by low to very low amounts of peppery phenols. There is a dry to balanced finish, with hops becoming more pronounced in the aftertaste of those with a drier finish. Fairly well balanced overall, with no single component being high in intensity; malt and fruitiness are more forward initially with a supportive bitterness and drying character coming on late.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-light body. Smooth palate. Alcohol level is restrained, and any warming character should be low if present. Medium to medium-high carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Most commonly found in the Flemish provinces of Antwerp and Brabant. Considered “everyday” beers (Category I). Compared to their higher alcohol Category S cousins, they are Belgian “session beers” for ease of drinking. Nothing should be too pronounced or dominant; balance is the key. Yeast character generally more subtle than many Belgian beers, with some of the fruitiness being hop-driven.</comments>
        <history>Produced by breweries with roots as far back as the mid-1700s, the most well-known examples were perfected after the Second World War with some influence from Britain, including hops and yeast strains.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner or pale ale malt contributes the bulk of the grist with (cara) Vienna and Munich malts adding color, body and complexity. Sugar is not commonly used as high gravity is not desired. Saazer-type hops, Styrian Goldings, East Kent Goldings or Fuggles are commonly used. Yeasts prone to moderate production of phenols are often used but fermentation temperatures should be kept moderate to limit this character.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Fairly similar to pale ales from England <em>(Strong Bitter</em> category), typically with a slightly different yeast character and a more varied malt profile. Less yeast character than many other Belgian beers, though.</comparison>

        <name>Bière de Garde</name>
        <impression>A fairly strong, malt-accentuated, lagered artisanal beer with a range of malt flavors appropriate for the color. All are malty yet dry, with clean flavors and a smooth character.</impression>
        <aroma>Prominent malty sweetness, often with a complex, light to moderate intensity toasty-bready-rich malt character. Low to moderate esters. Little to no hop aroma (may be a bit spicy, peppery, or herbal). Paler versions will still be malty but will lack richer, deeper aromatics and may have a bit more hops. Generally quite clean, although stronger versions may have a light, spicy alcohol note as it warms.</aroma>
        <appearance>Three main variations exist (blond, amber and brown), so color can range from golden-blonde to reddish-bronze to chestnut brown. Clarity is brilliant to fair, although haze is not unexpected in this type of often unfiltered beer. Well-formed head, generally white to off-white (varies by beer color), average persistence.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium to high malt flavor often with a toasty-rich, biscuity, toffee-like or light caramel-sweet character. Malt flavors and complexity tend to increase with beer color. Low to moderate esters and alcohol flavors. Medium-low hop bitterness provides some support, but the balance is always tilted toward the malt. Darker versions will have more of an initial malty-sweet impression than paler versions, but all should be malty in the palate and finish. The malt flavor lasts into the finish, which is medium-dry to dry, never cloying. Low to no hop flavor (spicy, peppery, or herbal), although paler versions can have slightly higher levels of herbal or spicy hop flavor (which can also come from the yeast). Smooth, well-lagered character, even if made with ale yeast. Aftertaste of malt (character appropriate for the color) with some dryness and light alcohol.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-light (lean) body, often with a smooth, creamy-silky character. Moderate to high carbonation. Moderate alcohol warming, but should be very smooth and never hot.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Three main variations are included in the style: the <strong>brown</strong> (<em>brune</em>), the <strong>blond</strong> (<em>blonde</em>), and the <strong>amber</strong> (<em>ambrée</em>). The darker versions will have more malt character, while the paler versions can have more hops (but still are malt-focused beers). A related style is Bière de Mars, which is brewed in March (Mars) for present use and will not age as well. Attenuation rates are in the 80-85% range. Some fuller-bodied examples exist, but these are somewhat rare. Age and oxidation in imports often increases fruitiness, caramel flavors, and adds corked and musty notes; these are all signs of mishandling, not characteristic elements of the style.</comments>
        <history>Name literally means "beer which has been kept or lagered." A traditional artisanal ale from Northern France brewed in early spring and kept in cold cellars for consumption in warmer weather. It is now brewed year-round.</history>
        <ingredients>The "cellar" character commonly described in literature is more of a feature of mishandled commercial exports than fresh, authentic products. The somewhat moldy character comes from the corks and/or oxidation in commercial versions, and is incorrectly identified as "musty" or "cellar-like." Base malts vary by beer color, but usually include pale, Vienna and Munich types. Darker versions will have richer malt complexity and sweetness from crystal-type malts. Sugar may be used to add flavor and aid in the dry finish. Lager or ale yeast fermented at cool ale temperatures, followed by long cold conditioning. Floral, herbal or spicy continental hops.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Related to the Belgian Saison style, the main difference is that the Bière de Garde is rounder, richer, malt-focused, and lacks the spicy, bitter character of a Saison.</comparison>
        <entryinstructions>Entrant <strong>must</strong> specify <em>blond</em>, <em>amber</em>, or <em>brown</em> bière de garde. If no color is specified, the judge should attempt to judge based on initial observation, expecting a malt flavor and balance that matches the color.</entryinstructions>

        <name>Belgian Blond Ale</name>
        <impression>A moderate-strength golden ale that has a subtle fruity-spicy Belgian yeast complexity, slightly malty-sweet flavor, and dry finish.</impression>
        <aroma>Light earthy or spicy hop nose, along with a lightly grainy-sweet malt character. Shows a subtle yeast character that may include spicy phenolics, perfumy or honey-like alcohol, or yeasty, fruity esters (commonly orange-like or lemony). Light sweetness that may have a slightly sugar-like character. Subtle yet complex.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light to deep gold color. Generally very clear. Large, dense, and creamy white to off-white head. Good head retention with Belgian lace.</appearance>
        <flavor>Smooth, light to moderate grainy-sweet malt flavor initially, but finishes medium-dry to dry with some smooth alcohol becoming evident in the aftertaste. Medium hop and alcohol bitterness to balance. Light hop flavor, can be spicy or earthy. Very soft yeast character (esters and alcohols, which are sometimes perfumy or orange/lemon-like). Light spicy phenolics optional. Some lightly caramelized sugar or honey-like sweetness on palate.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-high to high carbonation, can give mouth-filling bubbly sensation. Medium body. Light to moderate alcohol warmth, but smooth. Can be somewhat creamy.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Often has an almost lager-like character, which gives it a cleaner profile in comparison to many other Belgian styles. Belgians use the term <em>Blond</em>, while the French spell it <em>Blonde</em>. Most commercial examples are in the 6.5 - 7% ABV range. Many Trappist or artisanal Belgian beers are called <em>Blond</em> but those are not representative of this style.</comments>
        <history>Relatively recent development to further appeal to European Pils drinkers, becoming more popular as it is heavily marketed and widely distributed.</history>
        <ingredients>Belgian Pils malt, aromatic malts, sugar, Belgian yeast strains that produce complex alcohol, phenolics and perfumy esters, Saazer-type, Styrian Goldings, or East Kent Goldings hops. Spices are not traditionally used, although the ingredients and fermentation by-products may give an impression of spicing (often reminiscent of oranges or lemons). If spices are present, should be a background character only.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Similar strength as a Dubbel, similar character as a Belgian Strong Golden Ale or Tripel, although a bit sweeter and not as bitter.</comparison>

        <name>Saison</name>
        <impression>Most commonly, a pale, refreshing, highly-attenuated, moderately-bitter, moderate-strength Belgian ale with a very dry finish. Typically highly carbonated, and using non-barley cereal grains and optional spices for complexity, as complements the expressive yeast character that is fruity, spicy, and not overly phenolic. Less common variations include both lower-alcohol and higher-alcohol products, as well as darker versions with additional malt character.</impression>
        <aroma>Quite aromatic, with fruity, spicy, and hoppy characteristics evident. The esters can be fairly high (moderate to high), and are often reminiscent of citrus fruits such as oranges or lemons. The hops are low to moderate and are often spicy, floral, earthy, or fruity. Stronger versions can have a soft, spicy alcohol note (low intensity). Spicy notes are typically peppery rather than clove-like, and can be up to moderately-strong (typically yeast-derived). Subtle, complementary herb or spice additions are allowable, but should not dominate. The malt character is typically slightly grainy in character and low in intensity. Darker and stronger versions will have more noticeable malt, with darker versions taking characteristics associated with grains of that color (toasty, biscuity, caramelly, chocolate, etc.). In versions where sourness is present instead of bitterness, some of the sour character can be detected (low to moderate).</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale versions are often a distinctive pale orange but may be pale golden to amber in color (gold to amber-gold is most common). Darker versions may run from copper to dark brown. Long-lasting, dense, rocky white to ivory head resulting in characteristic Belgian lace on the glass as it fades. Clarity is poor to good, though haze is not unexpected in this type of unfiltered beer. Effervescent.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium-low to medium-high fruity and spicy flavors, supported by a low to medium soft malt character, often with some grainy flavors. Bitterness is typically moderate to high, although sourness can be present in place of bitterness (both should not be strong flavors at the same time). Attenuation is extremely high, which gives a characteristic dry finish essential to the style; a Saison should never finish sweet. The fruity character is frequently citrusy (orange or lemon), and the spices are typically peppery. Allow for a range of balance in the fruity-spicy characteristics; this is often driven by the yeast selection. Hop flavor is low to moderate, and generally spicy or earthy in character. The balance is towards the fruity, spicy, hoppy character, with any bitterness or sourness not overwhelming these flavors. Darker versions will have more malt character, with a range of flavors derived from darker malts (toasty, bready, biscuity, chocolate, etc.) that support the fruity-spicy character of the beer (roasted flavors are not typical). Stronger versions will have more malt flavor in general, as well as a light alcohol impression. Herbs and spices are completely optional, but if present should be used in moderation and not detract from the yeast character. The finish is very dry and the aftertaste is typically bitter and spicy. The hop bitterness can be restrained, although it can seem accentuated due to the high attenuation levels.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light to medium body. Alcohol sensation varies with strength, from none in table version to light in standard versions, to moderate in super versions. However, any warming character should be fairly low. Very high carbonation with an effervescent quality. There is enough prickly acidity on the tongue to balance the very dry finish. In versions with sourness, a low to moderate tart character can add a refreshing bite, but not be puckering (optional).</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Variations exist in strength and color, but they all have similar characteristics and balance, in particularly the refreshing, highly-attenuated, dry character with high carbonation. There is no correlation between strength and color. The balance can change somewhat with strength and color variations, but the family resemblance to the original artisanal ale should be evident. Pale versions are likely to be more bitter and have more hop character, while darker versions tend to have more malt character and sweetness, yielding a more balanced presentations. Stronger versions often will have more malt flavor, richness, and body simply due to their higher gravity. Although they tend to be very well-attenuated, they may not be perceived to be as dry as standard-strength saisons due to their strength. The Saison yeast character is a must, although maltier and richer versions will tend to mask this character more. Often called <em>Farmhouse ales</em> in the US, but this term is not common in Europe where they are simply part of a larger grouping of <em>artisanal ales</em>.</comments>
        <history>A provision ale originally brewed in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium, for consumption during the active farming season. Originally a lower-alcohol product so as to not debilitate field workers, but tavern-strength products also existed. Higher-strength and different-colored products appeared after WWII. The best known modern saison, Saison Dupont, was first produced in the 1920s. Originally a rustic, artisanal ale made with local farm-produced ingredients, it is now brewed mostly in larger breweries yet retains the image of its humble origins.</history>
        <ingredients>Not typically spiced, with the yeast, hops and grain providing the character; but spices are allowed if they provide a complementary character. Continental base malts are typical, but the grist frequently contains other grains such as wheat, oats, rye, or spelt. Adjuncts such as sugar and honey can also serve to add complexity and dry out the beer. Darker versions will typically use richer, darker malts, but not typically roasted types. Saazer-type, Styrian or East Kent Golding hops are commonly used. A wide range of herbs or spices can add complexity and uniqueness, but should always meld well with the yeast and hop character. Brettanomyces is not typical for this style; Saisons with Brett should be entered in the <em>American Wild Ale</em> category.</ingredients>
        <comparison>At standard strengths and pale color (the most common variety), like a more highly-attenuated, hoppy, and bitter Belgian blond ale with a stronger yeast character. At super strength and pale color, similar to a Belgian tripel, but often with more of a grainy, rustic quality and sometimes with a spicier yeast character.</comparison>
        <entryinstructions>The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify the <em>strength</em> (table, standard, super) and the <em>color</em> (pale, dark).</entryinstructions>

        <name>Belgian Golden Strong Ale</name>
        <impression>A pale, complex, effervescent, strong Belgian-style ale that is highly attenuated and features fruity and hoppy notes in preference to phenolics.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex with significant fruity esters, moderate spiciness and low to moderate alcohol and hop aromas. Esters are reminiscent of lighter fruits such as pears, oranges or apples. Moderate to moderately low spicy, peppery phenols. A low to moderate yet distinctive perfumy, floral hop character is often present. Alcohols are soft, spicy, perfumy and low-to-moderate in intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is light and slightly grainy-sweet to nearly neutral.</aroma>
        <appearance>Yellow to medium gold in color. Good clarity. Effervescent. Massive, long-lasting, rocky, often beady, white head resulting in characteristic Belgian lace on the glass as it fades.</appearance>
        <flavor>Marriage of fruity, spicy and alcohol flavors supported by a soft malt character. Esters are reminiscent of pears, oranges or apples. Low to moderately low phenols are peppery in character. A low to moderate spicy hop character is often present. Alcohols are soft and spicy, and are low-to-moderate in intensity. Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and bitterness leads to a dry finish with a low to moderately bitter aftertaste.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Very highly carbonated; effervescent. Light to medium body, although lighter than the substantial gravity would suggest. Smooth but noticeable alcohol warmth. No hot alcohol or solventy character.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>References to the devil are included in the names of many commercial examples of this style, referring to their potent alcoholic strength and as a tribute to the original example (Duvel). The best examples are complex and delicate. High carbonation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or <em>refermented in the bottle</em>).</comments>
        <history>Originally developed by the Moortgat brewery after WWI as a response to the growing popularity of Pilsner beers.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner malt with substantial sugary adjuncts. Saazer-type hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used - those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols - often aided by slightly warmer fermentation temperatures. Fairly soft water. Spicing is not traditional; if present, should be a background character only.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Strongly resembles a Tripel, but may be even paler, lighter-bodied and even crisper and drier; the drier finish and lighter body also serves to make the assertive hopping and yeast character more prominent. Tends to use yeast that favor ester development (particularly pome fruit) over spiciness in the balance.</comparison>

      <name>Trappist Ale</name>
      <notes><strong>Trappist</strong> is a protected legal appellation, and cannot be used commercially except by genuine Trappist monasteries that brew their own beer. However, we can use it to describe the type or styles of beer produced by those breweries and those who make beers of a similar style. Trappist type beers are all characterized by very high attenuation, high carbonation through bottle conditioning, and interesting (and often aggressive) yeast character.</notes>

        <name>Trappist Single</name>
        <impression>A pale, bitter, highly attenuated and well carbonated Trappist ale, showing a fruity-spicy Trappist yeast character, a spicy-floral hop profile, and a soft, supportive grainy-sweet malt palate.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium-low to medium-high Trappist yeast character, showing a fruity-spicy character along with medium-low to medium spicy or floral hops, occasionally enhanced by light herbal/citrusy spice additions. Low to medium-low grainy-sweet malt backdrop, which may have a light honey or sugar quality. Fruit expression can vary widely (citrus, pome fruit, stone fruit). Light spicy, yeast-driven phenolics found in the best examples. Bubblegum inappropriate.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale yellow to medium gold color. Generally good clarity, with a moderate-sized, persistent, billowy white head with characteristic lacing.</appearance>
        <flavor>Fruity, hoppy, bitter, and dry. Initial malty-sweet impression, with a grainy-sweet soft malt palate, and a dry, hoppy finish. The malt may have a light honeyed biscuit or cracker impression. Moderate spicy or floral hop flavor. Esters can be citrus (orange, lemon, grapefruit), pome fruit (apple, pear), or stone fruit (apricot, peach). Light to moderate spicy, peppery, or clove phenolics. Bitterness rises towards the crisp, dry finish, with an aftertaste of light malt, moderate hops and yeast character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body. Smooth. Medium-high to high carbonation, can be somewhat prickly. Should not have noticeable alcohol warmth.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Often not labeled or available outside the monastery, or infrequently brewed. Might also be called monk’s beer or Brother’s beer. Highly attenuated, generally 85% or higher.</comments>
        <history>While Trappist breweries have a tradition of brewing a lower-strength beer as a monk’s daily ration, the bitter, pale beer this style describes is a relatively modern invention reflecting current tastes. Westvleteren first brewed theirs in 1999, but replaced older lower-gravity products.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner malt, Belgian Trappist yeast, Saazer-type hops.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Like a top-fermented Belgian/Trappist interpretation of a German Pils - pale, hoppy, and well-attenuated, but showing prototypical Belgian yeast character. Has less sweetness, higher attenuation, less character malt, and is more hop-centered than a Belgian Pale Ale. More like a much smaller, more highly hopped tripel than a smaller Belgian Blond Ale.</comparison>

        <impression>A deep reddish-copper, moderately strong, malty, complex Trappist ale with rich malty flavors, dark or dried fruit esters, and light alcohol blended together in a malty presentation that still finishes fairly dry.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex, rich-sweet malty aroma, possibly with hints of chocolate, caramel and/or toast (but never roasted or burnt aromas). Moderate fruity esters (usually including raisins and plums, sometimes also dried cherries). Esters sometimes include banana or apple. Spicy phenols and higher alcohols are common (may include light clove and spice, peppery, rose-like and/or perfumy notes). Spicy qualities can be moderate to very low. Alcohol, if present, is soft and never hot or solventy. Low to no spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma, typically absent. The malt is most prominent in the balance with esters and a touch of alcohol in support, blending together for a harmonious presentation.</aroma>
        <appearance>Dark amber to copper in color, with an attractive reddish depth of color. Generally clear. Large, dense, and long-lasting creamy off-white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Similar qualities as aroma. Rich, complex medium to medium-full rich-sweet malt flavor on the palate yet finishes moderately dry. Complex malt, ester, alcohol and phenol interplay (raisiny flavors are common; dried fruit flavors are welcome; clove or pepper spiciness is optional). Balance is always toward the malt. Medium-low bitterness that doesn’t persist into the aftertaste. Low spicy, floral, or herbal hop flavor is optional and not usually present.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-full body. Medium-high carbonation, which can influence the perception of body. Low alcohol warmth. Smooth, never hot or solventy.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Most commercial examples are in the 6.5 - 7% ABV range. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or <em>refermented in the bottle</em>).</comments>
        <history>Originated at monasteries in the Middle Ages, and was revived in the mid-1800s after the Napoleonic era.</history>
        <ingredients>Belgian yeast strains prone to production of higher alcohols, esters, and phenolics are commonly used. Impression of complex grain bill, although traditional versions are typically Belgian Pils malt with caramelized sugar syrup or other unrefined sugars providing much of the character. Saazer-type, English-type or Styrian Goldings hops commonly used. No spices are traditionally used, although restrained use is allowable (background strength only).</ingredients>
        <comparison>Should not be as malty as a bock and should not have crystal malt-type sweetness. Similar in strength and balance as a Belgian Blond, but with a richer malt and ester profile. Less strong and intense as a Belgian Dark Strong Ale.</comparison>

        <name>Belgian Tripel</name>
        <impression>A pale, somewhat spicy, dry, strong Trappist ale with a pleasant rounded malt flavor and firm bitterness. Quite aromatic, with spicy, fruity, and light alcohol notes combining with the supportive clean malt character to produce a surprisingly drinkable beverage considering the high alcohol level.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex bouquet with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate fruity esters and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery, sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in intensity. The malt character is light, with a soft, slightly grainy-sweet or slightly honey-like impression. The best examples have a seamless, harmonious interplay between the yeast character, hops, malt, and alcohol.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity. Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in characteristic <em>Belgian lace</em> on the glass as it fades.</appearance>
        <flavor>Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a soft, rounded grainy-sweet malt impression, occasionally with a very light honey note. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character. Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes lemon, and are low to moderate. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy, and low in intensity. Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste with substantial spicy-fruity yeast character. The grainy-sweet malt flavor does not imply any residual sweetness.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the substantial gravity would suggest. Highly carbonated. The alcohol content is deceptive, and has little to no obvious warming sensation. Always effervescent.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30 IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or <em>refermented in the bottle</em>).</comments>
        <history>Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at Westmalle.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner malt, typically with pale sugar adjuncts. Saazer-type hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used - those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols - often aided by slightly warmer fermentation temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if used, should be a background character only. Fairly soft water.</ingredients>
        <comparison>May resemble a Belgian Golden Strong Ale but slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied, with more emphasis on phenolics and less on esters. Usually has a more rounded malt flavor but should never be sweet.</comparison>

        <name>Belgian Dark Strong Ale</name>
        <impression>A dark, complex, very strong Belgian ale with a delicious blend of malt richness, dark fruit flavors, and spicy elements. Complex, rich, smooth and dangerous.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex, with a rich-sweet malty presence, significant esters and alcohol, and an optional light to moderate spiciness. The malt is rich and strong, and can have a deep bready-toasty quality often with a deep caramel complexity. The fruity esters are strong to moderately low, and can contain raisin, plum, dried cherry, fig or prune notes. Spicy phenols may be present, but usually have a peppery quality not clove-like; light vanilla is possible. Alcohols are soft, spicy, perfumy and/or rose-like, and are low to moderate in intensity. Hops are not usually present (but a very low spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma is acceptable). No dark/roast malt aroma. No hot alcohols or solventy aromas.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep amber to deep coppery-brown in color (<em>dark</em> in this context implies <em>more deeply colored than golden</em>). Huge, dense, moussy, persistent cream- to light tan-colored head. Can be clear to somewhat hazy.</appearance>
        <flavor>Similar to aroma (same malt, ester, phenol, alcohol, and hop comments apply to flavor as well). Moderately malty-rich on the palate, which can have a sweet impression if bitterness is low. Usually moderately dry to dry finish, although may be up to moderately sweet. Medium-low to moderate bitterness; alcohol provides some of the balance to the malt. Generally malty-rich balance, but can be fairly even with bitterness. The complex and varied flavors should blend smoothly and harmoniously. The finish should not be heavy or syrupy.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>High carbonation but not sharp. Smooth but noticeable alcohol warmth. Body can range from medium-light to medium-full and creamy. Most are medium-bodied.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Authentic Trappist versions tend to be drier (Belgians would say <em>more digestible</em>) than Abbey versions, which can be rather sweet and full-bodied. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or <em>refermented in the bottle</em>). Sometimes known as a Trappist Quadruple, most are simply known by their strength or color designation.</comments>
        <history>Most versions are unique in character reflecting characteristics of individual breweries, produced in limited quantities and often highly sought-after.</history>
        <ingredients>Belgian yeast strains prone to production of higher alcohols, esters, and sometimes phenolics are commonly used. Impression of a complex grain bill, although many traditional versions are quite simple, with caramelized sugar syrup or unrefined sugars and yeast providing much of the complexity. Saazer-type, English-type or Styrian Goldings hops commonly used. Spices generally not used; if used, keep subtle and in the background.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Like a larger dubbel, with a fuller body and increased malt richness. Not as bitter or hoppy as a tripel, but of similar strength.</comparison>

      <notes>The Historical Beer category contains styles that either have all but died out in modern times, or that were much more popular in past times and are known only through recreations. This category can also be used for traditional or indigenous beers of cultural importance within certain countries. Placing a beer in the historical category does not imply that it is not currently being produced, just that it is a very minor style or perhaps is in the process of rediscovery by craft brewers.</notes>
      <notes><strong>Entry Instructions:</strong> The entrant must either specify a style with a BJCP-supplied description from the list below, or specify a different historical beer style that is not described elsewhere in these guidelines. In the case of a style that has changed substantially over the years (such as Porter or Stout), the entrant may specify an existing BJCP style as well as an era (e.g., 1820 English Porter). When the entrant specifies any style not on the BJCP-supplied list, the entrant must provide a description of the style for the judges in sufficient detail to allow the beer to be judged. If a beer is entered with just a style name and no description, it is very unlikely that judges will understand how to judge it. Currently defined examples: <em>Gose, Piwo Grodziskie, Lichtenhainer, Roggenbier, Sahti, Kentucky Common, Pre-Prohibition Lager, Pre-Prohibition Porter, London Brown</em>.</notes>

        <name>Historical Beer: Gose</name>
        <impression>A highly-carbonated, tart and fruity wheat ale with a restrained coriander and salt character and low bitterness. Very refreshing, with bright flavors and high attenuation.</impression>
        <aroma>Light to moderately fruity aroma of pome fruit. Light sourness, slightly sharp. Noticeable coriander, which can have an aromatic lemony quality, and an intensity up to moderate. Light bready, doughy, yeasty character like uncooked sourdough bread. The acidity and coriander can give a bright, lively impression. The salt may be perceived as a very light, clean sea breeze character or just a general freshness, if noticeable at all.</aroma>
        <appearance>Unfiltered, with a moderate to full haze. Moderate to tall sized white head with tight bubbles and good retention. Effervescent. Medium yellow color.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderate to restrained but noticeable sourness, like a squeeze of lemon in iced tea. Moderate bready/doughy malt flavor. Light to moderate fruity character of pome fruit, stone fruit, or lemons. Light to moderate salt character, up to the threshold of taste; the salt should be noticeable (particularly in the initial taste) but not taste overtly salty. Low bitterness, no hop flavor. Dry, fully-attenuated finish, with acidity not hops balancing the malt. Acidity can be more noticeable in the finish, and enhance the refreshing quality of the beer. The acidity should be balanced, not forward (although historical versions could be very sour).</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>High to very high carbonation, effervescent. Medium-light to medium-full body. Salt may give a slightly tingly, mouthwatering quality, if perceived at all. The yeast and wheat can give it a little body, but it shouldn’t have a heavy feel.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Served in traditional cylindrical glasses. Historical versions may have been more sour than modern examples due to spontaneous fermentation, and may be blended with syrups as is done with Berliner Weisse, or <em>Kümmel</em>, a liqueur flavored with caraway, cumin, and fennel. Modern examples are inoculated with lactobacillus, and are more balanced and generally don’t need sweetening. Pronounced <em>GOH-zeh</em>.</comments>
        <history>Minor style associated with Leipzig but originating in the Middle Ages in the town of Goslar on the Gose River. Documented to have been in Leipzig by 1740. Leipzig was said to have 80 Gose houses in 1900. Production declined significantly after WWII, and ceased entirely in 1966. Modern production was revived in the 1980s, but the beer is not widely available.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner and wheat malt, restrained use of salt and coriander seed, lactobacillus. The coriander should have a fresh, citrusy (lemon or bitter orange), bright note, and not be vegetal, celery-like, or ham-like. The salt should have a sea salt or fresh salt character, not a metallic, iodine note.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Perceived acidity is not as intense as Berliner Weisse or Gueuze. Restrained use of salt, coriander, and lactobacillus - should not taste overtly salty. Coriander aroma can be similar to a witbier. Haziness similar to a Weissbier.</comparison>

        <impression>A darker-colored, light-flavored, malt-accented beer with a dry finish and interesting character malt flavors. Refreshing due to its high carbonation and mild flavors, and highly sessionable due to being served very fresh and with restrained alcohol levels.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to medium grainy, corn-like or sweet maltiness with a low toast, biscuity-grainy, bready, or caramel malt accent. Medium to moderately-low hop aroma, usually floral or spicy in character. Clean fermentation character, with possible faint berry ester. Low levels of DMS are acceptable. No sourness. Malt-forward in the balance.</aroma>
        <appearance>Amber-orange to light brown in color. Typically clear, but may have some light haze due to limited conditioning. Foam stand may not be long lasting, and is usually white to beige in color.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderate grainy-sweet maltiness with low to medium-low caramel, toffee, bready, and/or biscuity notes. Generally light palate flavors typical of adjunct beers; a low grainy, corn-like sweetness is common. Medium to low floral or spicy hop flavor. Medium to low hop bitterness, which should neither be coarse nor have a harsh aftertaste. May exhibit light fruitiness. Balance in the finish is towards the malt. May have a lightly flinty or minerally-sulfate flavor in the finish. The finish is fairly dry, including the contributions of roasted grains and minerals. No sourness.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-light body with a relatively soft mouthfeel. Highly carbonated. Can have a creamy texture.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Modern characterizations of the style often mention a lactic sourness or sour mashing, but extensive brewing records from the larger breweries at the turn of the century have no indication of long acid rests, sour mashing, or extensive conditioning. This is likely a modern homebrewer invention, based on the supposition that since indigenous Bourbon distillers used a sour mash, beer brewers must also have used this process. No contemporaneous records indicate sour mashing or that the beer had a sour profile; rather the opposite, that the beer was brewed as an inexpensive, present-use ale. Enter soured versions in <em>American Wild Ale</em>.</comments>
        <history>A true American original style, Kentucky Common was almost exclusively produced and sold around the Louisville Kentucky metropolitan area from some time after the Civil War up to Prohibition. Its hallmark was that it was inexpensive and quickly produced, typically 6 to 8 days from mash to delivery. The beer was racked into barrels while actively fermenting (1.020 - 1.022) and tightly bunged to allow carbonation in the saloon cellar. There is some speculation that it was a variant of the lighter common or cream ale produced throughout much of the East prior to the Civil War and that the darker grains were added by the mostly Germanic brewers to help acidify the typical carbonate water of the Louisville area, or that they had a preference for darker colored beers. Up until the late 19th century, Kentucky Common was not brewed in the summer months unless cellars, usually used for malting, were used for fermentation. With the advent of ice machines, the larger breweries were able to brew year round. In the period from 1900 to prohibition, about 75% of the beer sold in the Louisville area was Kentucky Common. With prohibition, the style died completely as the few larger breweries that survived were almost exclusively lager producers.</history>
        <ingredients>Six-row barley malt was used with 35% corn grits to dilute the excessive protein levels along with 1 to 2% each caramel and black malt. Native American hops, usually about .2 pounds per barrel of Western hops for bittering and a similar amount of New York hops (such as Clusters) for flavor (15 minutes prior to knock out). Imported continental Saazer-type hops (.1 pounds per barrel) were added at knock out for aroma. Water in the Louisville area was typically moderate to high in carbonates. Mash water was often pre-boiled to precipitate the carbonate and Gypsum was commonly added. Considering the time from mash in to kegging for delivery was typically 6 to 8 days, clearly aggressive top-fermenting yeasts was used.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Like a darker-colored cream ale emphasizing corn, but with some light character malt flavor. Malt flavors and balance are probably closest to modern adjunct-driven international amber or dark lagers, Irish red ales, or Belgian pale ales.</comparison>

        <impression>A sour, smoked, lower-gravity historical German wheat beer. Complex yet refreshing character due to high attenuation and carbonation, along with low bitterness and moderate sourness.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderately strong fresh smoky aroma, light hints of sourness, medium-low fruity esters, possibly apples or lemons, moderate bready-grainy malt. The smoke character is stronger than the bready notes, and the smoke has a ‘dry’ character, like the remnants of an old fire, not a ‘greasy’ smoke.</aroma>
        <appearance>Tall off-white head, rocky and persistent. Deep yellow to light gold color. Fair clarity, may be somewhat hazy.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderately strong fruity flavor, possibly lemons or apples. Moderate intensity, clean lactic tartness (no funk). Similar smoky character as aroma (dry wood fire), medium strength. Dry finish, with acidity and smoke in the aftertaste. Low bitterness; the acidity is providing the balance, not hops. Fresh, clean palate and slightly puckery aftertaste. The wheat character is on the low side; the smoke and acidity are more prominent in the balance. The lemony-tart/green apple flavor is strongest in the finish, with smoke a close second. Complex.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Tingly acidity. High carbonation. Medium to medium-light body.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Served young. Smoke and sour is an unusual combination that is not for everyone.</comments>
        <history>Originating in Lichtenhain, in Thüringen (central Germany). Height of popularity was towards the end of the 1800s, and was widely available throughout Thüringen. Like a pre-1840 Berliner Weisse.</history>
        <ingredients>Smoked barley malt, wheat malt, lactobacillus, top-fermenting yeast. Grists vary, but the wheat would typically be 30-50%.</ingredients>
        <comparison>In the same general historical lower-alcohol top-fermenting central European wheat beer family as Gose, Grodziskie, and Berliner weisse, has elements of all of them but having its own unique balance - sour and smoke is not found in any of the other beers. Not as acidic as Berliner weisse, probably more like a smoked Gose without coriander and salt, or a Grodziskie with Gose-like acidity.</comparison>

        <impression>A luscious, sweet, malt-oriented dark brown ale, with caramel and toffee malt complexity and a sweet finish.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate malty-sweet aroma, often with a rich, caramel or toffee-like character. Low to medium fruity esters, often dark fruit like plums. Very low to no hop aroma, earthy or floral qualities.</aroma>
        <appearance>Medium to very dark brown color, but can be nearly black. Nearly opaque, although should be relatively clear if visible. Low to moderate off-white to tan head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Deep, caramel or toffee-like malty and sweet flavor on the palate and lasting into the finish. Hints of biscuit and coffee are common. Some fruity esters can be present (typically dark fruit); relatively clean fermentation profile for an English ale. Low hop bitterness. Hop flavor is low to non-existent, possibly earthy or floral in character. Moderately-low to no perceivable roasty or bitter black malt flavor. Moderately sweet finish with a smooth, malty aftertaste. May have a sugary-sweet flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body, but the residual sweetness may give a heavier impression. Medium-low to medium carbonation. Quite creamy and smooth in texture, particularly for its gravity.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Increasingly rare; Mann’s has over 90% market share in Britain, but in an increasingly small segment. Always bottled. Frequently used as a sweet mixer with cask mild and bitter in pubs. Commercial versions can be pasteurized and back-sweetened, which gives more of a sugary-sweet flavor.</comments>
        <history>Developed by Mann’s as a bottled product in 1902. Claimed at the time to be “the sweetest beer in London.” Pre-WWI versions were around 5% ABV, but same general balance. Declined in popularity in second half of 20th century, and now nearly extinct.</history>
        <ingredients>English pale ale malt as a base with a healthy proportion of darker caramel malts and often some roasted (black) malt and wheat malt (this is Mann’s traditional grist - others can rely on dark sugars for color and flavor). Moderate to high carbonate water. English hop varieties are most authentic, though with low flavor and bitterness almost any type could be used. Post-fermentation sweetening with lactose or artificial sweeteners, or sucrose (if pasteurized).</ingredients>
        <comparison>May seem somewhat like a less roasty version of a sweet stout (and lower-gravity, at least for US sweet stout examples) or a sweet version of a dark mild.</comparison>

        <impression>A low-gravity, highly-carbonated, light-bodied ale combining an oak-smoked flavor with a clean hop bitterness. Highly sessionable.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to moderate oak wood smoke is the most prominent aroma component, but can be subtle and hard to detect. A low spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma is typically present, and should be lower than or equal to the smoke in intensity. Hints of grainy wheat are also detected in the best examples. The aroma is otherwise clean, although light pome fruit esters (especially ripe red apple or pear) are welcome. No acidity. Slight water-derived sulfury notes may be present.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale yellow to medium gold in color with excellent clarity. A tall, billowy, white, tightly-knit head with excellent retention is distinctive. Murkiness is a fault.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderately-low to medium oak smoke flavor up front which carries into the finish; the smoke can be stronger in flavor than in aroma. The smoke character is gentle, should not be acrid, and can lend an impression of sweetness. A moderate to strong bitterness is readily evident which lingers through the finish. The overall balance is toward bitterness. Low but perceptible spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor. Low grainy wheat character in the background. Light pome fruit esters (red apple or pear) may be present. Dry, crisp finish. No sourness.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light in body, with a crisp and dry finish. Carbonation is quite high and can add a slight carbonic bite or prickly sensation. No noticeable alcohol warmth.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Pronounced in English as “pivo grow-JEES-kee-uh” (meaning: Grodzisk beer). Known as Grätzer (pronounced “GRATE-sir”) in German-speaking countries, and in some beer literature. Traditionally made using a multi-step mash, a long boil (~2 hours), and multiple strains of ale yeast. The beer is never filtered but Isinglass is used to clarify before bottle conditioning. Traditionally served in tall conical glassware to accommodate the vigorous foam stand.</comments>
        <history>Developed as a unique style centuries ago in the Polish city of Grodzisk (known as Grätz when ruled by Prussia and Germany). Its fame and popularity rapidly extended to other parts of the world in the late 19th and early 20&gt;th century. Regular commercial production declined after WWII and ceased altogether in the early-mid 1990s. This style description describes the traditional version during its period of greatest popularity.</history>
        <ingredients>Grain bill usually consists entirely of oak-smoked wheat malt. Oak-smoked wheat malt has a different (and less intense) smoke character than German beechwood-smoked barley malt; it has a drier, crisper, leaner quality - a bacon/ham smoke flavor is inappropriate. Saazer-type hops (Polish, Czech or German), moderate hardness sulfate water, and a relatively clean and attenuative continental ale yeast fermented at moderate ale temperatures are traditional. German hefeweizen yeast or other strains with a phenol or strong ester character are inappropriate.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Similar in strength to a Berliner Weisse, but never sour. Has a smoked character but less intense than in a Rauchbier.</comparison>

        <impression>A clean, refreshing, but bitter pale lager, often showcasing a grainy-sweet corn flavor. All malt or rice-based versions have a crisper, more neutral character. The higher bitterness level is the largest differentiator between this style and most modern mass-market pale lagers, but the more robust flavor profile also sets it apart.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to medium grainy, corn-like or sweet maltiness may be evident (although rice-based beers are more neutral). Medium to moderately high hop aroma, with a range of character from rustic to floral to herbal/spicy; a fruity or citrusy modern hop character is inappropriate. Clean lager character. Low DMS is acceptable. May show some yeast character, as with modern American lagers; allow for a range of subtle supporting yeast notes.</aroma>
        <appearance>Yellow to deep gold color. Substantial, long lasting white head. Bright clarity.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium to medium-high maltiness with a grainy flavor, and optionally a corn-like roundness and impression of sweetness. Substantial hop bitterness stands up to the malt and lingers through the dry finish. All malt and rice-based versions are often crisper, drier, and generally lack corn-like flavors. Medium to high hop flavor, with a rustic, floral, or herbal/spicy character. Medium to high hop bitterness, which should neither be overly coarse nor have a harsh aftertaste. Allow for a range of lager yeast character, as with modern American lagers, but generally fairly neutral.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body with a moderately rich, creamy mouthfeel. Smooth and well-lagered. Medium to high carbonation levels.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The classic American Pilsner was brewed both pre-Prohibition and post-Prohibition with some differences. OGs of 1.050-1.060 would have been appropriate for pre-Prohibition beers while gravities dropped to 1.044-1.048 after Prohibition. Corresponding IBUs dropped from a pre-Prohibition level of 30-40 to 25-30 after Prohibition.</comments>
        <history>A version of Pilsner brewed in the USA by immigrant German brewers who brought the process and yeast with them, but who had to adapt their recipes to work with native hops and malt. This style died out after Prohibition but was resurrected by homebrewers in the 1990s. Few commercial versions are made, so the style still remains mostly a homebrew phenomenon.</history>
        <ingredients>Six-row barley with 20% to 30% flaked maize (corn) or rice to dilute the excessive protein levels; modern versions may be all malt. Native American hops such as Clusters, traditional continental hops, or modern noble-type crosses are also appropriate. Modern American hops such as Cascade are inappropriate. Water with a high mineral content can lead to an unpleasant coarseness in flavor and harshness in aftertaste. A wide range of lager yeast character can be exhibited, although modern versions tend to be fairly clean.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Similar balance and bitterness as modern Czech Premium Pale Lagers, but exhibiting native American grains and hops from the era before US Prohibition. More robust, bitter, and flavorful than modern American pale lagers, and often with higher alcohol.</comparison>

        <comments>Rye is a huskless grain and is difficult to mash, often resulting in a gummy mash texture that is prone to sticking. Rye has been characterized as having the most assertive flavor of all cereal grains. It is inappropriate to add caraway seeds to a roggenbier (as some American brewers do); the rye character is traditionally from the rye grain only.</comments>
        <history>A specialty German rye beer originally brewed in Regensburg, Bavaria. Never a widely popular style, it has all but disappeared in modern times.</history>
        <ingredients>Malted rye typically constitutes 50% or greater of the grist (some versions have 60-65% rye). Remainder of grist can include pale malt, Munich malt, wheat malt, crystal malt and/or small amounts of debittered dark malts for color adjustment. Weizen yeast provides distinctive banana esters and clove phenols. Light usage of Saazer-type hops in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Lower fermentation temperatures accentuate the clove character by suppressing ester formation. Decoction mash traditionally used (as with weissbiers).</ingredients>
        <comparison>A more distinctive variant of a dunkelweizen using malted rye instead of malted wheat. American Rye Beers will not have the weizen yeast character, and likely more hops.</comparison>

        <impression>A sweet, heavy, strong traditional Finnish beer with a rye, juniper, and juniper berry flavor and a strong banana-clove yeast character.</impression>
        <aroma>High banana esters with moderate to moderately-high clove-like phenolics. Not sour. May have a low to moderate juniper character. Grainy malt, caramel, and rye in background. Light alcohol aroma. Sweet malt impression.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale yellow to dark brown color; most are medium to dark amber. Generally quite cloudy (unfiltered). Little head, due to low carbonation.</appearance>
        <flavor>Strong banana and moderate to moderately-high clove yeast character. Moderate grainy rye flavor. Low bitterness. Fairly sweet finish. Juniper can add a pine-like flavor; juniper berries can add a gin-like flavor; both should be complementary, not dominant. No noticeable hop flavor. Moderate caramel flavor but no roast. Multi-layered and complex, with kind of a wortiness that is unusual in other beer styles. Not sour.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Thick, viscous, and heavy with protein (no boil means no hot break). Nearly still to medium-low carbonation. Strongly warming from the alcohol level and young age, but often masked by sweetness.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The use of rye doesn’t mean that it should taste like caraway (a dominant flavor in rye bread). The use of juniper berries will give a flavor like gin (similarly flavored with juniper berries). The juniper acts a bit like hops in the balance and flavor, providing some counterpoint to the sweet malt.</comments>
        <history>An indigenous traditional style from Finland; a farmhouse tradition for at least 500 years, often brewed for festive occasions like summer weddings, and consumed within a week or two of brewing. A similar tradition exists in Estonia, where the beer is known as <em>koduolu</em>.</history>
        <ingredients>Malted barley along with malted and unmalted grains, often rye. Low hops. Juniper boughs used for lautering (traditionally in a hollowed-out log), but often producing a juniper/berry character. Often uses top-fermenting baker’s yeast in a fast, warm fermentation (German Weizen yeast is a good substitute). Not boiled; a long mash steep is used, with a separately added hop tea.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Strong resemblance to Weizenbocks, but sweet and thick with a rye and juniper character.</comparison>
        <examples>Now made year-round by several breweries in Finland.</examples>

      <name>American Wild Ale</name>
      <notes>The name <strong>American Wild Ale</strong> is in common use by craft brewers and homebrewers. However, the word <em>Wild</em> does not imply that these beers are necessarily spontaneously-fermented; rather, it indicates that they are influenced by microbes other than traditional brewer’s yeasts. This category is intended for a wide range of beers that do not fit traditional European sour or wild styles. All of the styles in this category are essentially specialty beers where many creative interpretations are possible, and the styles are defined only by the use of specific fermentation profiles and ingredients. As specialty styles, the mandatory description provided by the entrant is of the utmost importance to the judge.</notes>
      <notes>Throughout this category, Brett is used as an abbreviation for Brettanomyces. This is the term most craft brewers and homebrewers will use in conversation, if not in formal communications.</notes>
      <subcategory id="28A">
        <name>Brett Beer</name>
        <impression>Most often drier and fruitier than the base style suggests. Funky notes range from low to high, depending on the age of the beer and strain(s) of Brett used. Funkiness is generally restrained in younger 100% Brett examples, but tends to increase with age. May possess a light acidity, although this does not come from Brett.</impression>
        <aroma>Variable by base style. Young Brett-fermented beers will possess more fruity notes (e.g., tropical fruit, stone fruit, or citrus), but this is variable by the strain(s) of Brett used. For 100% Brett beers heavily hopped with American hop varieties, the fermentation-derived flavors are often difficult to tease from the hop aromatics. Older 100% Brett beers may start to develop a little funk (e.g., barnyard, wet hay, or slightly earthy or smoky notes), but this character should not dominate. If the beer is fermented with a brewer’s yeast in addition to Brett, some of the character of the primary yeast may remain. A faint sourness is acceptable but should not be a prominent character.</aroma>
        <appearance>Variable by base style. Clarity can be variable, and depends on the base style and ingredients used. Some haze is not necessarily a fault.</appearance>
        <flavor>Variable by base style. Brett character may range from minimal to aggressive. Can be quite fruity (e.g., tropical fruit, berry, stone fruit, citrus), or have some smoky, earthy, or barnyard character. Should not be unpleasantly funky, such as Band-Aid, fetid, nail polish remover, cheese, etc. Light sourness is acceptable with the beer being lightly tart, but should not be truly sour. Always fruitier when young, gaining more funk with age. May not be acetic or lactic. Malt flavors are often less pronounced than in the base style, leaving a beer most often dry and crisp due to high attenuation by the Brett.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Variable by base style. Generally a light body, lighter than what might be expected from the base style but an overly thin body is a fault. Generally moderate to high carbonation. Head retention is variable.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The base style describes most of the character of these beers, but the addition of Brett ensures a drier, thinner, and funkier product. Younger versions are brighter and fruitier, while older ones possess more depth of funk and may lose more of the base style character. Wood-aged versions should be entered in the Wild Specialty Beer style. The Brett character should always meld with the style; these beers should never be a ‘Brett bomb’. Note that Brett does not produce lactic acid.</comments>
        <history>Modern American craft beer interpretations of Belgian wild ales, or experimentations inspired by Belgian wild ales or historical English beers with Brett. 100% Brett beers gained popularity after the year 2000; Port Brewing Mo Betta Bretta was one of the first celebrated examples.</history>
        <ingredients>Virtually any style of beer, fermented in any manner, then finished with one or more strains of Brett. Alternatively, a beer made with Brett as the sole fermentation strain.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Compared to the same beer style without Brett, a Brett Beer will be drier, more highly attenuated, fruitier, lighter in body, and slightly funkier as it ages. Less sourness and depth than Belgian ‘wild’ ales.</comparison>
        <entryinstructions>The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify either a base beer style (Classic Style, or a generic style family) or provide a description of the ingredients/specs/desired character. The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify if a 100% Brett fermentation was conducted. The entrant <strong>may</strong> specify the strain(s) of Brettanomyces used.</entryinstructions>

        <impression>A sour and/or funky version of a base style of beer.</impression>
        <aroma>Variable by base style. The contribution of non-Saccharomyces microbes should be noticeable to strong, and often contribute a sour and/or funky, wild note. The best examples will display a range of aromatics, rather than a single dominant character. The aroma should be inviting, not harsh or unpleasant.</aroma>
        <appearance>Variable by base style. Clarity can be variable; some haze is not a fault. Head retention can be poor due to high levels of acid or anti-foam properties of some lactobacillus strains.</appearance>
        <flavor>Variable by base style. Look for an agreeable balance between the base beer and the fermentation character. A range of results is possible from fairly high acidity/funk to a subtle, pleasant, harmonious beer. The best examples are pleasurable to drink with the esters and phenols complementing the malt and/or hops. The wild character can be prominent, but does not need to be dominating in a style with an otherwise strong malt/hop profile. Acidity should be firm yet enjoyable, but should not be biting or vinegary; prominent or objectionable/offensive acetic acid is a fault. Bitterness tends to be low, especially as sourness increases.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Variable by base style. Generally a light body, almost always lighter than what might be expected from the base style. Generally moderate to high carbonation, although often lower in higher alcohol examples.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>These beers may be aged in wood, but any wood character should not be a primary or dominant flavor. Sour beers are typically not bitter as these flavors clash. The base beer style becomes less relevant because the various yeast and bacteria tend to dominate the profile. Inappropriate characteristics include diacetyl, solvent, ropy/viscous texture, and heavy oxidation.</comments>

        <aroma>Variable by base style. Should show the fruit, sour and/or funk of a wild fermentation, as well as the characteristics of the special ingredients used.

        <appearance>Variable by base style, generally showing a color, tint, or hue from any fruit (if used) in both the beer and the head. Clarity can be variable; some haze is not a fault. Head retention is often poor.</appearance>
        <flavor>Variable by base style. Should show the fruit, sour and/or funk of a wild fermentation, as well as the characteristics of the special ingredients used. Any fruit sweetness is generally gone, so only the esters typically remain from the fruit. The sour character from the fruit and wild fermentation could be prominent, but should not be overwhelming. The acidity and tannin from any fruit can both enhance the dryness of the beer, so care must be taken with the balance. The acidity should enhance the perception of the fruit flavor, not detract from it. Wood notes, if present, add flavor but should be balanced.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Variable by base style. Generally a light body, lighter than what might be expected from the base style. Generally moderate to high carbonation; carbonation should balance the base style if one is declared. The presence of tannin from some fruit or wood can provide a slight astringency, enhance the body, or make the beer seem drier than it is.</mouthfeel>

      <name>Fruit Beer</name>
      <notes>The Fruit Beer category is for beer made with any fruit or combination of fruit under the definitions of this category. The <strong>culinary, not botanical,</strong> definition of fruit is used here - fleshy, seed-associated structures of plants that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state. Examples include pome fruit (apple, pear, quince), stone fruit (cherry, plum, peach, apricot, mango, etc.), berries (any fruit with the word ‘berry’ in it), currants, citrus fruit, dried fruit (dates, prunes, raisins, etc.), tropical fruit (banana, pineapple, guava, papaya, etc.), figs, pomegranate, prickly pear, and so on. It does not mean spices, herbs, or vegetables as defined in Category 30, especially botanical fruit treated as culinary vegetables. Basically, if you have to justify a fruit using the word “technically” as part of the description, then that’s not what we mean.</notes>

        <aroma>The distinctive aromatics associated with the declared fruit should be noticeable in the aroma; however, note that some fruit (e.g., raspberries, cherries) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g., blueberries, strawberries) - allow for a range of fruit character and intensity from subtle to aggressive. The additional aromatics should blend well with whatever aromatics are appropriate for the declared base beer style.</aroma>
        <appearance>Appearance should be appropriate for the declared base beer and declared fruit. For lighter-colored beers with fruits that exhibit distinctive colors, the color should be noticeable. Note that the color of fruit in beer is often lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different shades. Fruit beers may have some haze or be clear, although haze is a generally undesirable. The head may take on some of the color of the fruit.</appearance>
        <flavor>As with aroma, the distinctive flavor character associated with the declared fruit should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive. The balance of fruit with the underlying beer is vital, and the fruit character should not be so artificial and/or inappropriately overpowering as to suggest a ‘fruit juice drink.’ Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content, and fermentation by-products, such as esters, should be appropriate to the base beer and be harmonious and balanced with the distinctive fruit flavors present. Remember that fruit generally add flavor not sweetness to fruit beers. The sugar found in fruit is usually fully fermented and contributes to lighter flavors and a drier finish than might be expected for the declared base style. However, residual sweetness is not necessarily a negative characteristic unless it has a raw, unfermented quality.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Mouthfeel may vary depending on the base beer selected and as appropriate to that base beer. Body and carbonation levels should be appropriate to the declared base beer style. Fruit generally adds fermentables that tend to thin out the beer; the resulting beer may seem lighter than expected for the declared base style. Smaller and darker fruit have a tendency to add a tannic depth that should overwhelm the base beer.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made fruit beer. The fruit should complement the original style and not overwhelm it. The key attributes of the underlying style will be different with the addition of fruit; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated version. Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and balance of the resulting combination.</comments>

      <notes>Di seguito vengono utilizzate le definizioni comuni o culinarie delle spezie, delle erbe e dei vegetali, non quelle botaniche o scientifiche. In generale, le spezie sono semi secchi, baccelli dei semi, radici, corteccia, ecc. di piante usate per insaporire il cibo. Le erbe sono piante con foglie o parti di piante (foglie, fiori, petali, gambi) usate per insaporire il cibo. I vegetali sono qui intesi come piante commestibili, saporite, non dolci, usate primariamente cotte o talvolta crude. I vegetali possono includere alcuni frutti botanici. Questa categoria comprende esplicitamente tutte le spezie culinarie, le erbe e i vegetali, come pure la frutta secca (nocciole, noci di cocco, ecc.), peperoni, peperoncini, caffè, cioccolato, germogli di abete, rosa canina, carcadè, la buccia di alcuni frutti (ma non il succo), il rabarbaro e via dicendo. Non comprende la frutta o i cereali. Gli zuccheri fermentabili e gli sciroppi (nettare di agave, sciroppo d’acero, melasse, sorgo, miele, ecc.) possono essere utilizzati solo in combinazione con altri ingredienti permessi e non dovrebbero avere un carattere dominante. Si può anche inserire una combinazione di ingredienti permessi. Vedi categoria 29 per la definizione di esempi della frutta.</notes>

        <impression>Matrimonio armonioso tra SEV e birra ma ancora riconoscibile come birra. Le caratteristiche delle SEV devono essere evidenti ma in equilibrio con la birra e non troppo marcate da far pensare a un prodotto artificiale.</impression>
        <aroma>Il carattere delle particolari spezie, erbe, vegetali (d’ora in poi SEV) deve essere percepibile nell’aroma, tuttavia bisogna evidenziare che alcune spezie, come lo zenzero o la cannella, hanno aroma più forte e sono più caratterizzate di altre, tipo alcuni vegetali, quindi è bene ammettere una buona varietà di caratteristiche e intensità delle SEV, variabili da lievi ad aggressive. Il carattere individuale di ciascuna SEV può non sempre essere identificabile quando è usata in combinazione con altre. L’aroma di luppolo può essere assente o equilibrato dalle SEV, a seconda dello stile. Le SEV dovrebbero aggiungere una complessità extra alla birra ma non essere eccessive da sbilanciare il prodotto finale.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deve essere appropriato alla birra base e con gli ingredienti speciali dichiarati. Per le birre più chiare con SEV con colori caratterizzati, tali colori possono essere osservabili nella birra e probabilmente anche nella schiuma. Possono essere lievemente torbide o limpide. La formazione della schiuma può essere influenzata negativamente da alcuni ingredienti, tipo la cioccolata.</appearance>
        <flavor>Come per l’aroma, le caratteristiche gustative associate con particolari SEV devono essere percepibili e variano dal lieve all’aggressivo. Il carattere individuale di ciascuna SEV può non sempre essere identificabile quando è usata in combinazione con altre. L’equilibrio delle SEV con la birra sottostante è vitale e le caratteristiche delle SEV non devono essere così artificiali o dominanti da sovrastare la birra. L’amaro del luppolo, il gusto, i gusti del malto, il contenuto alcolico e i sottoprodotti della fermentazione, come gli esteri, devono essere appropriati alla birra base ed essere in armonia ed equilibrati con i distinti gusti delle SEV presenti. Alcune SEV sono di per sé amare e il risultato può essere una birra più amara dello stile base dichiarato.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Il boccato può variare a seconda della birra base scelta o può essere appropriato proprio a quella birra base. Anche il corpo e la carbonazione dovrebbero essere appropriati allo stile della birra base. Alcune SEV possono aggiungere corpo, anche se le aggiunte di prodotti fermentabili possono snellire la birra. Alcune SEV possono aggiungere lieve astringenza ma non è desiderabile ottenere un carattere da spezia “grezza”.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>La chiave di presentazione di una birra con SEV ben fatta è l’equilibrio. Le SEV dovrebbero fare da complemento allo stile originale, non coprirlo. Gli attributi chiave dello stile sottostante saranno naturalmente diversi con l’aggiunta delle SEV e non ci si deve attendere che la birra base abbia lo stesso gusto della versione non adulterata. Giudicare la birra sulla base della piacevolezza e sull’equilibrio della combinazione che ne risulta. Il carattere individuale di ciascuna SEV può non sempre essere identificabile quando è usata in combinazione con altre.</comments>

        <notes>Le birre stagionali autunnali ricordano le temperature più fresche e la stagione dei raccolti agricoli e includono le zucche e le spezie associate.</notes>
        <impression>Birra speziata di colore ambrato-ramato che ha spesso un corpo moderatamente ricco e un finale leggermente caldo che accompagna bene la stagione fresca ed evoca spesso le tradizioni della Festa del Ringraziamento.</impression>
        <aroma>È possibile un’ampia gamma di aromi, anche se molti esempi ricordano le torte di zucca, la patata americana candita o piatti americani simili e legati ai raccolti o al giorno del ringraziamento. È apprezzabile qualsiasi combinazione di aromi che ricorda l’autunno. Lo stile della birra base ha spesso un profilo maltato che sostiene la presentazione equilibrata delle sostanze aromatiche, dalle spezie ad altri ingredienti speciali. Altri fermentabili aggiunti (zucchero di canna, miele, melassa, sciroppo d’acero) offrono i propri aromi caratteristici. L’aroma di luppolo è spesso assente, mitigato o leggermente speziato. In alcuni esempi si possono trovare i composti aromatici dell’alcol ma questa caratteristica deve essere attenuata. L’aroma globale deve essere bilanciato e armonioso e spesso alquanto complesso e invitante.</aroma>
        <appearance>Generalmente da medio-ambrata a bruno-ramata (le versioni più chiare sono le più comuni). Di solito limpida, anche se le versioni più scure possono essere virtualmente opache. Accettabile lieve torbidezza da eccessivo raffreddamento. In genere ha una schiuma ben formata, con colore da avorio a marroncino. Alcune versioni con la zucca assumono una sfumatura di color arancione, insolita per la birra.</appearance>
        <flavor>Sono possibili svariate interpretazioni, il produttore deve sentirsi libero nella sua creatività fintanto che il prodotto risultante è equilibrato ed è speziato (e opzionalmente con zuccheri e vegetali). Sono tipiche le spezie associate all’autunno (vedi la sezione aroma). Le spezie e le aggiunte di prodotti fermentabili devono fare da supporto e miscelarsi bene con lo stile della birra base. Sono comuni gusti ricchi e/o dolci derivati dal malto e possono includere caramello, tostato, biscottato o nocciola (gusti di crosta di pane tostato e di crosta di torta cotta sono graditi). La birra può avere gusti caratteristici derivati dai prodotti fermentabili aggiunti (melassa, miele, zucchero di canna scuro, ecc.), anche se questi elementi non sono richiesti specificamente. Il gusto impartito dalle zucche è spesso sfuggente. L’ampia gamma di ingredienti speciali deve fare da supporto ed equilibrio e non essere eccessivo, tale da mettere in ombra la birra base. L’amaro e i gusti del luppolo sono in genere contenuti per non interferire con le spezie e gli ingredienti speciali. In genere il finale è alquanto pieno e soddisfacente, spesso con un gusto alcolico. Sono tipicamente assenti le caratteristiche del malto torrefatto.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Sono possibili svariate interpretazioni. Il corpo è generalmente da medio a pieno e una certa masticabilità maltosa o derivata dai vegetali è spesso presente. È tipica una carbonazione da moderatamente bassa a moderatamente alta. Molti esempi mostrano un buon invecchiamento e una alcolicità riscaldante, senza però essere bruciante. Le birre non devono essere così forti per mostrare degli effetti riscaldanti.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>La chiave di presentazione di una birra autunnale ben fatta è l’equilibrio. Gli ingredienti speciali dovrebbero fare da complemento alla birra base, non coprirla. Il produttore deve essere consapevole che alcune combinazioni di stili di birra base con ingredienti speciali lavorano bene insieme, mentre altri non creano combinazioni armoniose. Se la birra base è uno stile classico, questo stile deve essere evidente nell’aroma e nel gusto. Quando sono dichiarate le SEV, ciascuna deve essere percepibile e distinta (anche se non necessariamente identificabile singolarmente, l’equilibrio con gli altri ingredienti è sempre critico) – in altre parole la birra deve essere percepita come speziata ma senza che sia necessario distinguere quali spezie specifiche sono presenti (anche se sono dichiarate).</comments>
        <ingredients>Sono richieste le spezie e spesso sono quelle che evocano l’autunno o la stagione del Ringraziamento (pepe giamaicano/allspice, noce moscata, cannella, chiodi di garofano, zenzero) ma è possibile qualsiasi combinazione e si deve incoraggiare la creatività. Le aggiunte ricche di gusto tipo melassa, miele, sciroppo di acero, ecc. sono spesso impiegate, così come vari tipi di zucca.</ingredients>

        <history>Storicamente sono state prodotte birre più alcoliche e più ricche, da consumarsi durante il periodo natalizio, quando vecchi amici si ritrovano per festeggiare insieme. Molti birrifici producono birre stagionali che possono essere più scure, più alcoliche e speziate o con più carattere delle loro birre normali. Le versioni speziate sono una tradizione americana e belga, dal momento che i birrifici inglesi e tedeschi tradizionalmente non aggiungo spezie alle loro birre.</history>
        <ingredients>Generalmente si tratta di ale, ma esistono anche lager scure e alcoliche.

L’intensità e le caratteristiche dell’affumicato e della birra base possono variare, nel senso che l’uno o l’altro possono essere prominenti nell’equilibrio. L’affumicato varia da basso a deciso, ma è bene ricordare che la chiave per un prodotto ben fatto è l’equilibrio generale.

        <flavor>Come per l’aroma, deve esserci un equilibrio tra l’affumicato e i gusti previsti dallo stile della birra base. L’affumicato varia da basso a deciso. Il gusto dell’affumicato varia dal legnoso a qualcosa di simile alla pancetta, a seconda del tipo di malti usati. L’equilibrio tra le caratteristiche della birra base e l’affumicato possono variare, anche se il connubio risultante deve essere in qualche modo equilibrato e gradevole. L’affumicato può aggiungere del secco nel finale. Sono in genere inappropriati gusti aspri, amari, di bruciato, catrame, gomma, solfurei, medicinali o fenolici derivati dall’affumicato, anche se alcune di queste caratteristiche possono essere presenti in alcuni stili base e il malto affumicato non dovrebbe contribuire ad accrescerle.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Boccato variabile a seconda dello stile della birra base. Sono inappropriati una sensazione significativa di astringenza e un’asprezza fenolica derivata dall’affumicato.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Questo stile riguarda qualsiasi birra che abbia un proprio stile e che presenti l’affumicato come aroma e gusto principali, a parte la Rauchbier nello stile di Bamberg, cioè una Märzen affumicata con legno di faggio, già dettagliata in precedenza. Qualsiasi stile di birra può essere affumicato, l’obiettivo è di raggiungere un piacevole equilibrio tra il carattere dell’affumicato e lo stile base della birra. Le birre in concorso dovrebbero essere giudicate per l’aderenza allo stile e sul bilanciamento con l’affumicato. Le birre che citano un affumicato caratteristico saranno giudicate secondo la riconoscibilità delle caratteristiche affumicate e per come queste si sposino con lo stile base. Infine, le birre dovrebbero essere giudicate principalmente sull’equilibrio globale e su come le caratteristiche dell’affumicato migliorano la birra base.</comments>
        <history>La procedura di usare malti affumicati è stata adattata a molti stili birrari da parte dei produttori artigianali. I birrai tedeschi hanno tradizionalmente impiegato malti affumicati nelle Bock, Doppelbock, Weissbier, Dunkel, Schwarzbier, Helles, Pils e in altre specialità.</history>
        <ingredients>I diversi legni usati per affumicare il malto impartiscono gusto e aroma caratteristici e unici. Si possono usare malti affumicati con faggio o altri legni duri (quercia, acero, mesquite, ontano, pecan, melo, ciliegio e altro legno di alberi da frutto). I vari legni possono far ricordare qualche prodotto affumicato per un collegamento alimentare (ad esempio il noce americano con le cotolette, l’acero con la pancetta o le salsicce e l’ontano col salmone). Non si dovrebbero mai usare legno di piante sempreverdi perché aggiungerebbe al malto un gusto di medicinale o di conifera. Un malto con marcato torbato è universalmente indesiderabile per la terrosità e i fenoli aspri e pungenti. I restanti ingredienti variano a seconda dello stile base. Se i malti affumicati sono combinati con altri ingredienti insoliti (frutta, verdure, spezie, miele, ecc.), la birra risultante deve essere inserita nella categoria seguente, la Specialty Smoked Beer.</ingredients>

        <aroma>Varia a seconda dello stile base. Di solito è presente un aroma di legno o quercia da basso a moderato. Il legno “fresco” può a volte impartire grossolani aromi “verdi”, una caratteristica che non dovrebbe mai essere troppo marcata. Altri aromi opzionali sono la vaniglia, il caramello, il toffee, il tostato o il cacao provenienti da sostanze carbonizzate presenti nel legno. L’aroma di alcol dovrebbe essere delicato e bilanciato, non bruciante. Opzionale una ossidazione di fondo che può assumere una piacevole nota di sherry ma non deve essere di carta o cartone. Non deve avere caratteristiche da alcol aggiunto.</aroma>
        <appearance>Varia a seconda dello stile base. Spesso più scura dello stile di partenza, in particolare se si usano botti catramate o tostate a fuoco.</appearance>
        <flavor>Varia a seconda dello stile base. Le botti di solito impartiscono gusti legnosi o di quercia che occasionalmente assumono un grossolano gusto “verde”, se le botti sono nuove. Altri gusti che possono essere presenti sono vaniglia (dalla vanillina nel legno), caramello, caramella mou, pane tostato o mandorle (dal legno tostato), caffè, cioccolato e cacao (dal legno torrefatto). I gusti di legno e/o altri derivati dalla botte devono essere bilanciati, di supporto e percepibili ma non devono coprire lo stile della birra base. Opzionale il gusto di ossidato nello sfondo, che può assumere una piacevole nota di sherry, ma non deve essere di carta o cartone.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Varia con lo stile di base. Il legno può aggiungere tannini alla birra, a seconda della età della botte. I tannini apportano maggiore astringenza (che non deve mai essere elevata) o semplicemente un boccato più pieno. L’aspro o l’acido devono essere da bassi ad assenti e mai fuorvianti.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Lo stile base della birra deve essere percepibile e le caratteristiche impartite dal legno devono essere evidenti ma non così dominanti da sbilanciare la birra. L’intensità dei gusti del legno dipende dal tempo di contatto col legno stesso, dall’età, dalle condizioni, dall’origine e dal livello di catramatura della botte e anche dal tipo di legno. NON SI DEVE USARE QUESTA CATEGORIA PER STILI DI BASE DOVE LA MATURAZIONE IN BOTTI È UN REQUISITO FONDAMENTALE DELLO STILE (ad esempio le Flanders Red o i Lambic, ecc.). Le birre prodotte con invecchiamento in botte limitato nel tempo o quelle che hanno un lieve carattere legnoso di sfondo dovrebbero essere inserite nelle categorie degli stili base, dal momento che le caratteristiche del legno non sono così in evidenza.</comments>
        <history>Metodo di produzione tradizionale raramente usato dai grossi birrifici e solo per birre speciali. È più popolare presso i moderni produttori artigianali americani in cerca di prodotti nuovi e particolari. Sono tradizionali i fusti e cask in legno di quercia, anche se altri legni stanno diventando più popolari.</history>
        <ingredients>Variano a seconda dello stile di base. La Birra può essere maturata in botti di legno o usando additivi a base di legno (scaglie di legno, essenza di quercia). Sono spesso usati gli stili che hanno corpo pieno e gravità elevata perché sostengono meglio i gusti aggiuntivi, anche se le sperimentazioni con altri stili sono incoraggiate.</ingredients>
        <entryinstructions>Si devono specificare il tipo di legno usato e il livello di catramatura (se catramato), lo stile base, che può essere uno classico del BJCP (nominare la sub-categoria) o un tipo generico di birra (Porter, Brown Ale). Se si utilizza legno atipico, una breve descrizione degli aspetti sensoriali che il legno in questione impartisce alla birra deve essere fornita.</entryinstructions>

      <title>Introduction to Mead Guidelines (Categories M1-M4)</title>
      <revision number="1">2015</revision>
      <section>
        <paragraph>The following discussion applies to all the mead styles, except where explicitly superseded in the sub-category guidelines. This introduction identifies common characteristics and descriptions for all types of mead, and should be used as a reference whenever entering or judging mead.</paragraph>
      </section>
      <section>
        <sectiontitle>1. Important Attributes</sectiontitle>
        <definitionlist>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Sweetness.</definitionterm>
            <definition>A mead may be <em>dry</em>, <em>semi-sweet</em>, or <em>sweet</em>. Sweetness simply refers to the amount of residual sugar in the mead. Sweetness is often confused with fruitiness in a dry mead. Body is related to sweetness, but dry meads can still have some body. Dry meads do not have to be bone dry. Sweet meads should not be cloyingly sweet, and should not have a raw, unfermented honey character. Sweetness is independent of strength. Note that tannin levels can affect the perceived sweetness of mead (more tannin makes a mead seem drier), but acidity is more related to the quality, balance, and enjoyment of the sweetness. The purpose of identifying a sweetness level is primarily to aid in the ordering of a flight. <em>Minor differences from stated sweetness level should not be heavily-penalized or considered a disqualifying fault.</em> </definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Carbonation</definitionterm>
            <definition>A mead may be <em>still</em>, <em>petillant</em>, or <em>sparkling</em>. Still meads do not have to be totally flat; they can have some very light bubbles. Petillant meads are lightly sparkling and can have a moderate, noticeable amount of carbonation. Sparkling meads are not gushing, but may have a character ranging from mouth-filling to an impression akin to Champagne or carbonated water. <em>Minor differences from stated carbonation level should not be heavily-penalized or considered a disqualifying fault</em> </definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Strength</definitionterm>
            <definition>A mead may be categorized as <em>hydromel</em>, <em>standard</em>, or <em>sack</em> strength. Strength refers to the alcohol content of the mead (and also, therefore, the amount of honey and fermentables used to make the mead). Stronger meads can have a greater honey character and body (as well as alcohol) than weaker meads, although this is not a strict rule. Well-made stronger examples may have difficult-to-detect strength. <em>Minor differences from stated strength level should not be heavily-penalized or considered a disqualifying fault.</em> </definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Honey variety.</definitionterm>
            <definition>Some types of honey have a strong varietal character (aroma, flavor, color, acidity). If a honey is unusual, additional information can be provided to judges as to the character to be expected. Note that <em>wildflower</em> isn’t a varietal honey; it is specifically a term used to describe a honey derived from an unknown source or from mixed flowers or blossoms. Consider providing a description of the honey if it is not listed in the Mead Exam Study Guide or other BJCP references. Identifying the source (state or region) and season of the honey can be useful information for the judges.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Special ingredients.</definitionterm>
            <definition>Different styles may include fruit, spice, malt, etc. Judges need to understand the ingredients that provide a unique character in order to properly evaluate the mead. Oak additions do not have to be specified (but may be at the entrant’s discretion); <em>oaking is acceptable in every mead style</em>. Excessive oaking is a fault, just as in wine; any use of oak should be balanced and complimentary. A declared use of oak should not be interpreted as requiring the oak to be a primary flavor.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
        </definitionlist>
      </section>
      <section>
        <sectiontitle>2. Standard Description for Mead</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>When individual mead style descriptions use the phrase <strong>Standard Description Applies</strong>, refer to the sections below that have the same names as are used in the style descriptions. These descriptions are incorporated by reference into every style where they are mentioned. Statements in the individual style descriptions build on, modify, or supersede the standard descriptions below.</paragraph>
        <definitionlist>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Appearance:</definitionterm>
            <definition>Clarity may be good to brilliant. Crystal clear, reflective examples with a bright, distinct meniscus are highly desirable. Observable particulates (even in an otherwise clear example) are undesirable. Highly carbonated examples usually have a short-lasting head similar to Champagne or soda pop. Some aspects of bubbles or head formation that may be observed and commented upon include size (large or small), persistence (how long do they continue to form?), quantity (how much are present?), rate (how fast do they form?), and mousse (appearance or quality of foam stand). The components of bubbles (or <em>head</em>) will vary greatly depending on the carbonation level, ingredients and type of mead. In general, smaller bubbles are more desirable and indicative of higher quality than larger bubbles. The color may vary widely depending on honey variety and any optional ingredients (e.g., fruit, malts). Some honey varieties are almost clear, while others can be dark brown. Most are in the straw to gold range. If no honey variety is declared, almost any color is acceptable. If a honey variety is declared, the color should generally be suggestive of the honey used (although a wide range of color variation is still possible). Hue, saturation and purity of color should be considered. Stronger versions (standard and sack) may show signs of body (e.g., legs, meniscus) but higher carbonation levels can interfere with this perception.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Aroma:</definitionterm>
            <definition>The intensity of the honey aroma will vary based upon the sweetness and strength of the mead. Stronger or sweeter meads may have a stronger honey aroma than drier or weaker versions. Different varieties of honey have different intensities and characters; some (e.g., orange blossom, buckwheat) are more readily recognizable than others (e.g., avocado, palmetto). If honey varieties are declared, the varietal character of the honey should be apparent even if subtle. The aromatics may seem vinous (similar to wine), and may include fruity, floral, or spicy notes. The bouquet (rich, complex aromatics arising from the combination of ingredients, fermentation and aging) should show a pleasant, clean fermentation character, with fresh aromatics being preferred over dirty, muddled, yeasty, or sulfury notes. A multi-faceted bouquet, also known as complexity or depth, is a positive attribute. Phenolic aromatics should not be present. Harsh or chemical aromatics should not be present. Oxidation is a big detraction in most mead, and most frequently appears as a strong sherry-like or light molasses-like character. A subtle, sherry-like oxidation character can add complexity in some situations, but not if the oxidation ruins the character of the mead. Alcohol aromatics may be present, but hot, solventy or irritating overtones are a defect. The harmony and balance of the aroma and bouquet should be pleasant and enticing.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Flavor:</definitionterm>
            <definition>The intensity of the honey flavor will vary based upon the sweetness and strength of the mead. Stronger, sweeter meads will have a stronger honey flavor than drier, weaker versions. Different varieties of honey have different intensities and characters; some (e.g., orange blossom, buckwheat) are more readily recognizable than others (e.g., safflower, palmetto). If honey varieties are declared, the varietal character of the honey should be apparent even if subtle. The residual sweetness level will vary with the sweetness of the mead; dry meads will have no residual sugar, sweet meads will have noticeable to prominent sweetness, semi-sweet meads will have a balanced sweetness. In no case should the residual sweetness be syrupy, cloying or seem like unfermented honey. Any additives, such as acid or tannin, should enhance the honey flavor and lend balance to the overall character of the mead but not be excessively tart or astringent. Tannin can make a mead seem drier than the residual sugar levels might suggest. Artificial, chemical, harsh, phenolic or bitter flavors are defects. Higher carbonation (if present) enhances the acidity and gives a “bite” to the finish. The aftertaste should be evaluated; longer finishes are generally most desirable. A multi-faceted flavor, also known as complexity or depth, is a positive attribute. Yeast or fermentation characteristics may be none to noticeable, with estery, fresh and clean flavors being most desirable. Alcohol flavors (if present) should be smooth and well-aged, not harsh, hot, or solventy. Very light oxidation may be present, depending on age, but an excessive molasses, sherry-like or papery character should be avoided. Aging and conditioning generally smooth out flavors and create a more elegant, blended, rounded product. All flavors tend to become more subtle over time, and can deteriorate with extended aging.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Mouthfeel:</definitionterm>
            <definition>Before evaluating, refer to the declared sweetness, strength and carbonation levels, as well as any special ingredients; these can all affect mouthfeel. Well-made examples will often have an elegant wine-like character. The body can vary widely, although most are in the medium-light to medium-full range. Body generally increases with stronger and/or sweeter meads, and can sometimes be quite full and heavy. Similarly, body generally decreases with lower gravity and/or drier meads, and can sometimes be quite light. Sensations of body should not be accompanied by an overwhelmingly cloying sweetness (even in sweet meads). A very thin or watery body is likewise undesirable. Some natural acidity is often present (particularly in fruit-based meads). Low levels of astringency are sometimes present (either from specific fruit or spices, or from tea, chemical additives or oak-aging). Acidity and tannin help balance the overall honey, sweetness and alcohol presentation. The level of carbonation can vary widely (see definitions above). Still meads may have a very light level of carbonation, lightly carbonated (petillant) meads will have noticeable bubbles, and a highly carbonated (sparkling) mead can range from a mouth-filling carbonation to levels approaching Champagne or soda pop. High carbonation will enhance the acidity and give a “bite” to the finish. A warming alcohol presence is often present, and this character usually increases with strength (although extended aging can smooth this sensation).</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Overall Impression:</definitionterm>
            <definition>A wide range of results are possible, but well-made examples will have an enjoyable balance of honey flavors, sweetness, acidity, tannins, alcohol. Strength, sweetness and age greatly affect the overall presentation. Any special ingredients should be well-blended with the other ingredients, and lead to a harmonious end product.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Ingredients:</definitionterm>
            <definition>Mead is made primarily from honey, water and yeast. Some minor adjustments in acidity and tannin can be made with citrus fruits, tea, or chemicals; however, these additives should not be readily discernable in flavor or aroma. Yeast nutrients may be used but should not be detected. Oak aging is allowable in any category as a subtle to noticeable enhancement without causing the mead to be an <em>Experimental Mead</em>; excessive oak is a fault.</definition>

If honey varieties are declared, judges will look for the varietal character of the honey. Note that the character of a varietal honey will be identifiable as distinct to the source flowers, but may not resemble the source plant, tree, or fruit. For example, orange-blossom honey has the character of orange blossoms, not oranges; blackberry honey is only distantly like blackberries, although it is an identifiable character. If a mead is oak-aged and the oak character is noticeable, the oaking can be specified. Judges should expect to detect oak, but not as a primary flavor.</definition>

      <name>Fruit Mead</name>
      <notes>A mead made with fruit is called a <strong>Melomel</strong> , although some melomels also have other names (cyser, pyment). We are introducing category names for certain types of melomels based on the variety of fruit used; these are more entry categories than actual styles. We selected different names for the category and subcategories to avoid the confusion of using the same names in different ways.</notes>
      <notes>See the <em>Introduction to Mead Guidelines</em> for detailed descriptions of standard mead characteristics, an explanation of standard terms, and entering instructions.</notes>
      <notes>Refer to Category M1 descriptions for additional detail on the character to be expected from dry, semi-sweet and sweet meads. Use those guidelines to judge distinctions between the various sweetness levels. Judging meads from dry to sweet is recommended as the primary ordering, with strength being the secondary ordering criterion.</notes>
      <subcategory id="M2A">
        <name>Cyser</name>
        <notes>A <strong>Cyser</strong> is a melomel made with apples (generally cider).</notes>
        <impression>In well-made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead. Some of the best strong examples have the taste and aroma of an aged Calvados (apple brandy from northern France), while subtle, dry versions can taste similar to many fine white wines. There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and honey character but not necessarily an even balance. Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist.</impression>
        <aroma>Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and apple/cider character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The apple/cider character should be clean and distinctive; it can express a range of apple-based character ranging from a subtle fruitiness to a single varietal apple character (if declared) to a complex blend of apple aromatics. Some spicy or earthy notes may be present, as may a slightly sulfury character. The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Slight spicy phenolics from certain apple varieties are acceptable, as is a light diacetyl character from malolactic fermentation (both are optional). Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</aroma>
        <appearance>Standard description applies, except with regard to color. Color may range from pale straw to deep golden amber (most are yellow to gold), depending on the variety of honey and blend of apples or ciders used.</appearance>
        <flavor>The apple and honey flavor intensity may vary from none to high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel to sack). Natural acidity and tannin in apples may give some tartness and astringency to balance the sweetness, honey flavor and alcohol. Tannin levels may make a cyser seem drier than the residual sugar levels might suggest. A cyser may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties have different intensities). Slight spicy phenolics from certain apple varieties are acceptable, as are a light diacetyl character from malolactic fermentation and a slight sulfur character (all are optional). Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Standard description applies. Often wine-like. Some natural acidity is usually present (from the blend of apples) and helps balance the overall impression. Some apples can provide natural astringency, but this character should not be excessive.</mouthfeel>
        <ingredients>Standard description applies. Cyser is a mead made with the addition of apples or apple juice. Traditionally, cysers are made by the addition of honey to apple juice without additional water.</ingredients>
        <entryinstructions><em>See</em> Introduction to Mead Guidelines <em>for entry requirements.</em> Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify carbonation level, strength, and sweetness. Entrants <strong>MAY</strong> specify honey varieties. Entrants <strong>MAY</strong> specify the varieties of apple used; if specified, a varietal character will be expected. Products with a relatively low proportion of honey are better entered as a <em>Specialty Cider</em>. A spiced cyser should be entered as a <em>Fruit and Spice Mead</em>. A cyser with other fruit should be entered as a <em>Melomel</em>. A cyser with additional ingredients should be entered as an <em>Experimental Mead</em> </entryinstructions>

        <name>Pyment</name>
        <notes>A <strong>Pyment</strong> is a melomel made with grapes (generally from juice). Pyments can be red, white, or blush, just as with wine.</notes>
        <impression>In well-made examples of the style, the grape is both distinctively vinous and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead. White and red versions can be quite different, and the overall impression should be characteristic of the type of grapes used and suggestive of a similar variety wine. There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and honey character but not necessarily an even balance. Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist.</impression>
        <aroma>Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and grape/wine character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The grape/wine character should be clean and distinctive; it can express a range of grape-based character ranging from a subtle fruitiness to a single varietal grape character (if declared) to a complex blend of grape or wine aromatics. Some complex, spicy, grassy or earthy notes may be present (as in wine). The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Slight spicy phenolics from certain red grape varieties are acceptable, as is a light diacetyl character from malolactic fermentation in certain white grape varieties (both are optional). Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</aroma>
        <appearance>Standard description applies, except with regard to color. Color may range from pale straw to deep purple-red, depending on the variety of grapes and honey used. The color should be characteristic of the variety or type of grape used, although white grape varieties may also take on color derived from the honey variety.</appearance>
        <flavor>The grape/wine and honey flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel to sack). Natural acidity and tannin in grapes may give some tartness and astringency to balance the sweetness, honey flavor and alcohol. A pyment may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties have different intensities). Depending on the grape variety, some fruity, spicy, grassy, buttery, earthy, minerally, and/or floral flavors may be present. Some versions (particularly red pyments) may be oak-aged, with additional flavor complexity. Tannin levels may make the pyment seem drier than residual sugar levels might suggest. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Standard description applies. Wine-like. Some natural acidity is usually present (from grapes) and helps balance the overall impression. Grape tannin and/or grape skins can add body as well as some astringency, although this character should not be excessive. Use of oak can also add this character. Longer aging can smooth out tannin-based astringency.</mouthfeel>
        <ingredients>Standard description applies. A pyment is a mead made with the addition of grapes or grape juices. Alternatively, the pyment may be a homemade grape-based wine sweetened with honey, or a mead mixed with homemade grape-based wine after fermentation.</ingredients>

        <name>Berry Mead</name>
        <notes>A <strong>Berry Mead</strong> is an entry category for melomels made with berries, such as raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, currants (black, red, and white), strawberries, boysenberries, elderberries, marionberries, mulberries, lingonberries, huckleberries, cranberries, etc. Generally any fruit with ‘berry’ in the name would qualify. Berries can have seeds, but do not have stones/pits; some are aggregates of druplets. Combinations of berries can be entered here. The culinary, not botanical, definition of berry is used here. If you have to justify a fruit using the word “technically” as part of the description, then that’s not what we mean.</notes>
        <impression>In well-made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead. Different types of fruit can result in widely different characteristics; allow for a variation in the final product.</impression>
        <aroma>Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and fruit character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The fruit character should display distinctive aromatics associated with the particular fruit(s); however, note that some fruit (e.g., raspberries) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g., blueberries, strawberries) — allow for a range of fruit character and intensity from subtle to aggressive. The fruit character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial, raw, and/or inappropriately overpowering (considering the character of the fruit). In a blended berry mead, not all fruit may be individually identifiable or of equal intensity. The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Some tartness may be present if naturally occurring in the particular fruit(s), but should not be inappropriately intense. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</aroma>
        <appearance>Standard description applies, except with regard to color. Color may take on a very wide range of colors, depending on the variety of fruit and/or honey used. For lighter-colored meads with fruits that exhibit distinctive colors, the color should be noticeable. Note that the color of fruit in mead is often lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different shades. Meads made with lighter color fruits can also take on color from varietal honeys. In meads that produce a head, the head can take on some of the fruit color as well.</appearance>
        <flavor>The fruit and honey flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel to sack). The natural acidity and tannin levels from fruit and fruit skins will vary, and this character is expected to be present in the mead, although in balance with sweetness, honey flavor, and alcohol. Tannin levels may make some meads seem drier than the residual sweetness might suggest. A berry mead may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties have different intensities). The distinctive flavor character associated with the particular fruit(s) should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive. The balance of fruit with the underlying mead is vital, and the fruit character should not be artificial, raw (unfermented), and/or inappropriately overpowering. In a blended berry mead, not all fruit may be individually identifiable or of equal intensity. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Standard description applies. Most will be wine-like. Some natural acidity and/or tannin are sometimes present (from certain fruit and/or fruit skin) and helps balance the overall impression. Fruit tannin can add body as well as some astringency. High levels of astringency are undesirable. The acidity and tannin levels should be somewhat reflective of the fruit used.</mouthfeel>
        <ingredients>Standard description applies. A berry mead is a mead made with the addition of other berries or berry juices, including a blend of berries. There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and honey character but not necessarily an even balance.</ingredients>
        <comments>Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist. Some fruits, notably darker ones like blackberries, may contribute a tannin presence similar to a red wine.</comments>

For lighter-colored meads with fruits that exhibit distinctive colors, the color should be noticeable. Note that the color of fruit in mead is often lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different shades. Meads made with lighter color fruits can also take on color from varietal honeys. In meads that produce a head, the head can take on some of the fruit color as well.</appearance>
        <flavor>The fruit and honey flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel to sack). The natural acidity and tannin levels from fruit and fruit skins will vary, and this character is expected to be present in the mead, although in balance with sweetness, honey flavor, and alcohol. Tannin levels may make some meads seem drier than the residual sweetness might suggest. A stone fruit mead may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties have different intensities). The distinctive flavor character associated with the particular fruit(s) should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive. The balance of fruit with the underlying mead is vital, and the fruit character should not be artificial, raw (unfermented), and/or inappropriately overpowering. In a blended stone fruit mead, not all the fruits may be individually identifiable or of equal intensity. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Standard description applies. Most will be wine-like. Some natural acidity and/or tannin are sometimes present (from certain fruit and/or fruit skin) and helps balance the overall impression. Fruit tannin can add body as well as some astringency. High levels of astringency are undesirable. The acidity and tannin levels should be somewhat reflective of the fruit used.</mouthfeel>
        <ingredients>Standard description applies. A stone fruit mead is a mead made with the addition of other stone fruit or stone fruit juices. There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and honey character but not necessarily an even balance. A stone fruit mead can be made with a blend of stone fruits, but not other fruit not allowable in this category.</ingredients>
        <comments>Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist.</comments>

        <name>Melomel</name>
        <notes>The <strong>melomel</strong> subcategory is for fruit meads made with any fruit not associated with any other fruit mead subcategory, or with a combination of fruits from multiple fruit mead subcategories (such as grapes and stone fruit). Some examples include citrus fruit, dried fruits (dates, prunes, raisins, etc.), pears, figs, pomegranates, prickly pear, bananas, pineapples, and most other tropical fruit. If in doubt, enter the fruit here – judges should be flexible with fruit not explicitly named in other categories. The use of <em>Melomel</em> as a subcategory name does not imply that other meads in the <em>Fruit Mead</em> category are not also melomels; the choice was made to avoid using the same word twice in different contexts. The culinary, not botanical, definition of fruit is used here. If you have to justify a fruit using the word “technically” as part of the description, then that’s not what we mean.</notes>
        <impression>In well-made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead. Different types of fruit can result in widely different characteristics; allow for a variation in the final product.</impression>
        <aroma>Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and fruit character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions).

The fruit character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial, raw (unfermented), and/or inappropriately overpowering (considering the character of the fruit). In a blended fruit melomel, not all the fruits may be individually identifiable or of equal intensity. The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose.

        <impression>In well-made examples of the style, the fruits and spices are both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead. Different types of fruits and spices can result in widely different characteristics; allow for significant variation in the final product.</impression>
        <aroma>Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey, fruit, and spice character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The spice character should display distinctive aromatics associated with the particular spices; however, note that some spices (e.g., ginger, cinnamon) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g., chamomile, lavender) — allow for a range of spice character and intensity from subtle to aggressive. The spice character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial and inappropriately overpowering (considering the character of the spice). The fruit character should display distinctive aromatics associated with the particular fruit; however, note that some fruits (e.g., raspberry, cherry) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g., peach) — allow for a range of fruit character and intensity from subtle to aggressive.

The distinctive flavor character associated with the particular spices may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive (although some spices may not be individually recognizable, and can just serve to add a background complexity). Certain spices might add bitter, astringent, phenolic or spicy (hot) flavors; if present, these qualities should be related to the declared ingredients (otherwise, they are faults), and they should balance and blend with the honey, sweetness and alcohol.

        <impression>A harmonious blend of mead and beer, with the distinctive characteristics of both. A wide range of results are possible, depending on the base style of beer, variety of honey and overall sweetness and strength. Beer flavors tend to somewhat mask typical honey flavors found in other meads.</impression>
        <aroma>Depending on the sweetness, strength and base style of beer, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and beer character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The honey and beer/malt character should be complementary and balanced, although not always evenly balanced. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). If a base style of beer or type of malt is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable character reflective of the beer style (different styles and malts have different intensities and characters). A hop aroma (any variety or intensity) is optional; if present, it should blend harmoniously with the other elements. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</aroma>
        <appearance>Standard description does not apply due to beer-like characteristics. Clarity may be good to brilliant, although many braggots are not as clear as other meads. A light to moderate head with some retention is expected if the mead is carbonated. Color may range from light straw to dark brown or black, depending on the variety of malt and honey used. The color should be characteristic of the declared beer style and/or honey used, if a variety is declared. Stronger versions may show signs of body (e.g., legs).</appearance>
        <flavor>Displays a balanced character identifiable as both a beer and a mead, although the relative intensity of flavors is greatly affected by the sweetness, strength, base style of beer, and variety of honey used. If a beer style is declared, the braggot should have some character traceable to the style although the flavors will be different due to the presence of honey. If a variety of honey is declared, the braggot should feature a subtle to prominent varietal character (different varieties have different intensities). Stronger and/or sweeter braggots should be expected to have a greater intensity of flavor than drier, lower gravity versions. The finish and aftertaste will vary based on the declared level of sweetness (dry to sweet), and may include both beer and mead components. A wide range of malt characteristics is allowable, from plain base malts to rich caramel and toast flavors to dark chocolate and roast flavors. Hop bitterness and flavor may be present, and may reflect any variety or intensity; however, this optional character should always be both suggestive of the base beer style and well blended with the other flavors. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Standard description does not apply due to beer-like characteristics. Smooth mouthfeel without astringency. Body may vary from moderately light to full, depending on sweetness, strength, and the base style of beer. Note that stronger meads will have a fuller body. A very thin or watery body is undesirable, as is a cloying, raw sweetness. A warming sense of well-aged alcohol may be present in stronger examples. Carbonation will vary as described in the standard description. A still braggot will usually have some level of carbonation (like a cask bitter) since a completely flat beer is unappetizing. However, just as an aged barleywine may be still, some braggots can be totally still.</mouthfeel>
        <ingredients>A braggot is a mead made with both honey and malt providing flavor and fermentable extract. Originally, and alternatively, a mixture of mead and ale. A braggot can be made with any type of honey, and any type of base beer style. The malt component may be derived from grain or malt extracts. The beer may be hopped or not. If any other ingredients than honey and beer are contained in the braggot, it should be entered as an <em>Experimental Mead</em>. Smoked braggots may be entered in this category if using smoked malt or a smoked beer as the base style; braggots made using other smoked ingredients (e.g., liquid smoke, chipotles) should be entered in the <em>Experimental Mead</em> style.</ingredients>
        <comments>Sometimes known as <em>bracket</em> or <em>brackett</em>. The fermentable sugars come from a balance of malt or malt extract and honey, although the specific balance is open to creative interpretation by brewers.</comments>

      <revision number="1">2015</revision>
      <section>
        <paragraph>The following discussion applies to all the cider styles, except where explicitly superseded in the sub-category guidelines. This introduction identifies common characteristics and descriptions for all types of cider, and should be used as a reference whenever entering or judging cider.</paragraph>
        <paragraph><strong>Cider</strong> is fermented apple juice. <strong>Perry</strong> is fermented pear juice. There are two categories for cider and perry: <em>Standard Cider and Perry</em> (Category C1) and <em>Specialty Cider and Perry</em> (Category C2). The Standard category covers ciders and perries made primarily or entirely from the juice of apples or pears (but not both at once). The only adjunct permitted in the Standard category, and only in some sub-categories, is a limited addition of sugar to achieve a suitable starting gravity or to raise sweetness post-fermentation. Note that honey is not a “sugar” for this purpose; a cider made with added honey must be entered either as a Specialty cider or as a Cyser under the appropriate mead sub-category. Other sugar sources that also add significant flavors (brown sugar, molasses) would also create a Specialty cider (such as New England style).</paragraph>

          <ul>
            <li>Ciders and perries do not necessarily present overtly fruity aromas or flavors — in the same sense that a wine does not taste overtly of grapes. Drier styles of cider in particular develop more complex but less fruity characters. A simple <em>apple soda</em> or <em>wine cooler</em> character is not desirable in a cider or perry.</li>
            <li>Some styles of cider exhibit distinctly <strong>non-</strong> fruity tastes or aromas, such as the <em>smoky ham</em> undertones of a dry English cider.</li>
            <li>The <strong>sweetness</strong> (residual sugar, or RS) of a cider or perry may vary from absolutely dry (no RS) to as much as a sweet dessert wine (10% or more RS). In sweeter ciders, other components of taste — particularly acidity — must balance the sweetness. The level of sweetness must be specified so organizers and judges can arrange flights of tastings and entries within flights. Tasting should always proceed from drier to sweeter. There are five categories of sweetness, expanded from three in earlier guidelines. Note that the numbers for these levels are <strong>not</strong> rigid or restrictive. They are intended to guide the cidermaker on how to enter, not to be used as judging criteria unless a cider is declared at a sweetness level far from its actual sweetness. Judges must realize that sweetness can mask faults. Be more attentive to this in a sweeter cider. Likewise, do not penalize dry ciders excessively for minor faults which may be more evident only because of lack of sweetness. The categories and <em>approximate</em> sugar levels are as follows. Final gravities are particularly rough numbers since they cannot take account of what the SG would be if the cider fermented out completely.<ul><li><strong>Dry:</strong> below 0.4% residual sugar. This corresponds to a final specific gravity less than 1.002. There is no perception of sweetness.</li><li><strong>Medium-dry:</strong> 0.4-0.9% residual sugar. This corresponds to a final specific gravity of 1.002-1.004. There is a hint of sweetness but the cider is still perceived primarily as dry. Also known as semi-dry.</li><li><strong>Medium:</strong> in the range between dry and sweet, 0.9-2.0% residual sugar, final gravity 1.004-1.009. Sweetness is now a notable component of the overall character.</li><li><strong>Medium-sweet:</strong> 2.0-4.0% residual sugar, final gravity 1.009-1.019. The cider is sweet but still refreshing. Also known as semi-sweet.</li><li><strong>Sweet:</strong> above 4.0% residual sugar, roughly equivalent to a final gravity of over 1.019. The cider has the character of a dessert wine. It must not be cloying; see notes on balance.</li></ul></li>
            <li>If a cider is close to one of these boundaries, it should be identified by the sweetness category which best describes the overall impression it gives. The five categories above were expanded from the earlier three dry-medium-sweet by splitting the dry and medium categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Acidity</strong> is an essential element of cider and perry: it must be sufficient to give a clean, refreshing impression without being puckering. Acidity (from malic and in some cases lactic acids) must not be confused with acetification (from ethyl acetate or acetic acid—vinegar). The acrid aroma and tingling taste of acetification is a fault.</li>
            <li>Ciders and perries vary considerably in <strong>tannin</strong> . This affects both bitterness and astringency (see <em>Mouthfeel</em> below). If made from culinary or table fruit, tannins are typically low; nevertheless some tannin is desirable to balance the character. The character contributed by tannin should be mainly astringency rather than bitterness. An overt or forward bitterness is a fault, and is often due to processing techniques rather than fruit character.</li>
            <li>Cider may go through a <strong>malo-lactic fermentation</strong> (MLF) which converts some or all of the sharp malic acid to softer, less-acidic lactic acid. (Perries should not go through MLF because it will cause undesirable acetification.) In ciders made with tannic apples, the MLF commonly produces ethylphenols which are evident as other flavors: spicy/smoky including smoked meat, phenolic, and farmyard/old-horse. These flavors are desirable although not mandatory in English and French styles, but must not be <em>over the top</em>. The spicy-smoky character is the most desirable of the three. Note that a dominating farmyard character may be the result of a Brettanomyces contamination rather than MLF; this is a serious fault. Also, because MLF reduces the acidity of a cider, the result should not be <em>flabby</em> or too soft; the cider must remain refreshing. Finally, judges should be attentive to the possibility of faults such as mousiness which are more likely in a higher pH cider that has gone through MLF. (Some judges may be unable to detect <em>mouse</em>; an alkaline oral rinse may be needed to confirm and reach agreement among judges.)</li>

            <li>Clarity may vary from good to brilliant. The lack of sparkling clarity is not a fault, but visible particles are undesirable. In some styles a “rustic” lack of brilliance is common. Perries are notoriously difficult to clear; as a result a slight haze is not a fault. However, a “sheen” in either cider or perry generally indicates the early stage of lactic contamination and is a distinct fault.</li>
            <li>Carbonation may vary from entirely still to a champagne level. No or little carbonation is termed <strong>still</strong> . A still cider may give a slight <em>tickle on the tongue</em>. A moderate carbonation level is termed <strong>petillant</strong> . Highly carbonated is termed <strong>sparkling</strong> . At the higher levels of carbonation, the <em>mousse</em> (head) may be retained for a short time. However, gushing, foaming, and difficult-to-manage heads are faults.</li>

            <li>In general, cider and perry have a body and fullness akin to a light wine. The body is much less than that of beer. Mouthfeel depends on tannin level. Tannic styles (English and French) will have astringent mouthfeel resembling a red wine. Full-sparkling ciders will be champagne-like.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>The apple and pear varieties are intended to illustrate commonly used examples, not dictate requirements when making the style. In general, adjuncts and additives are prohibited except where specifically allowed in particular styles, and then the entrant must state them. Common processing aids, and enzymes, are generally allowed as long as they are not detectable in the finished cider. Yeast used for cider/perry may be either <em>natural</em> (the yeast which occurs on the fruit itself and/or is retained in the milling and pressing equipment) or <em>cultured</em> yeast. Malo-lactic fermentation is allowed, either naturally occurring or with an added ML culture. Enzymes may be used for clarification of the juice prior to fermentation. Malic acid may be added to a low-acid juice to bring acidity up to a level considered safe for avoiding bacterial contamination and off-flavors (typically pH 3.8 or below). Sulfites may be added as needed for microbiological control. If used, the maximum accepted safe level for sulfites (200 mg/l) must be strictly observed; moreover, any excess sulfite that is detectable in the finished cider (a “burning match” character) is a serious fault.</li>
            <li>If a cider is to have sweetness (residual sugar), this may be obtained by arresting fermentation or back-sweetening with sugar or fresh juice. In this case, entrant must ensure that the cider is stable. Turbidity, gushing, or foaming resulting from restarted fermentation in-bottle are considered serious faults.</li>
            <li>If the cider is fermented and/or aged with wood (barrel, chips, staves/strips), the type of wood and process must be declared. Except for category C2F (Specialty Cider/Perry), the wood character must be no more than barely recognizable. A cider with substantial wood/barrel character entered in any category other than C2F will be regarded as not in the style.</li>
            <li>Sorbate may be added at bottling to stabilize the cider. However, any residual aroma/flavor from excessive use or misuse of sorbate (e.g., a <em>geranium</em> note) is a distinct fault.</li>
            <li>Carbonation may be either natural (by maintaining CO<sub>2</sub>pressure through processing or by bottle-conditioning) or added (by CO<sub>2</sub>injection). In most categories, a still (completely uncarbonated) cider is appropriate. Judges must realize that carbonation can improve a naive impression of a cider and must not penalize still ciders (when declared properly) for lack of carbonation.</li>

      <notes>The styles represented in this category are the principal established styles. "New World" is simply a name change from the "Common" of earlier versions.</notes>
      <notes>There are known styles not represented here. In particular, Spanish (Asturian and Basque) does not yet have a style definition because there is presently insufficient appreciation and understanding, as well as a lack of commercial examples of known quality for reference.</notes>
      <notes>In the case of a cider made to a style not explicitly represented here, it should be entered in the closest applicable category. The first decision is whether the cider was made with apples with significant tannin content that gives the cider noticeable astringency or bitterness. If not, it should be entered as a New World Cider. If so, the choice is between the English and French sub-categories; this decision should be based on whether the cider tends more toward sweet, rich, somewhat fruity (French) or drier and more austere (English). For perry of a non-represented style, the decision is, as above, based on tannin content. If in doubt, enter as New World Perry.</notes>

        <name>New World Cider</name>
        <notes>A <strong>New World Cider</strong> is made from culinary/table apples, with wild or crab apples often used for acidity/tannin balance. Compared to other styles in this category, these ciders are generally relatively lower in tannin and higher in acidity. "New World" references the style, not a location, as ciders in this style are also made in eastern England, Australia, Germany, etc.</notes>
        <impression>A refreshing drink of some substance - not bland or watery. Sweet ciders must not be cloying. Dry ciders must not be too austere.</impression>
        <flavor>Sweet or low-alcohol ciders may have apple aroma and flavor. Dry ciders will be more wine-like with some esters. Sugar and acidity should combine to give a refreshing character. Acidity is medium to high, refreshing, but must not be harsh or biting.</flavor>
        <appearance>Clear to brilliant, pale to medium gold in color.</appearance>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body. Some tannin should be present for slight to moderate astringency, but little bitterness.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>An ideal cider serves well as a "session" drink, and suitably accompanies a wide variety of food.</comments>
        <entryinstructions>Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify sweetness (5 categories).

        <notes><strong>English Cider</strong> includes the English "West Country" plus ciders inspired by that style. These ciders are made with bittersweet and bitter-sharp apple varieties cultivated specifically for cider making. English ciders are traditionally fermented and aged in wood barrels, which adds some character; however, the barrels used are rarely new, so there is no overt wood character.</notes>
        <impression>Generally dry, full-bodied, austere. Complex flavor profile, long finish.</impression>
        <flavor>No overt apple character, but various flavors and esters that suggest apples, particularly tannic varieties. English-style ciders commonly go through MLF (see <em>Introduction/Aroma-and-Flavor</em>) which produces desirable spicy/smoky, phenolic, and farmyard/old-horse characters. These flavor notes are positive but <strong>not</strong> required. If present, they must not dominate; in particular, the phenolic and farmyard notes should not be heavy. A strong farmyard character without spicy/smoky or phenolic suggests a <em>Brettanomyces</em> contamination, which is a fault. Mousiness is a serious fault.</flavor>
        <appearance>Barely cloudy to brilliant. Medium yellow to amber color.</appearance>
        <mouthfeel>Full. Moderate to high tannin, perceived as astringency and some bitterness. Carbonation still to moderate. Bottle-fermented or -conditioned ciders may have high carbonation, up to champagne levels, but not gushing or foaming.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Sweet examples exist, but dry is most traditional, particularly when considering the drying contributions of tannin.</comments>
        <entryinstructions>Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify sweetness (dry through medium-sweet, 4 levels).

        <notes>Traditional French procedures use small amounts of salt and calcium compounds (calcium chloride, calcium carbonate) to aid the process of pectin coagulation.

        <name>Applewine</name>
        <notes>The term for this category is traditional but possibly misleading: it is simply a cider with substantial added sugar to achieve higher alcohol than a standard cider. As such it comes closer to a white wine than any other style. No fruit other than apples may be used in this style.</notes>
        <impression>Typically like a dry white wine, balanced, and with low astringency and bitterness.</impression>
        <flavor>Comparable to a New World Cider. Cider character must be distinctive. Very dry to sweet, although often dry.</flavor>
        <appearance>Clear to brilliant, pale to medium-gold. Cloudiness or hazes are inappropriate.</appearance>
        <mouthfeel>Lighter than other ciders, because higher alcohol is derived from addition of sugar rather than juice. Carbonation may range from still to champagne-like.</mouthfeel>
        <entryinstructions>Entrants  <strong>MUST</strong>  specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants  <strong>MUST</strong>  specify sweetness (5 levels).</entryinstructions>

        <name>Ice Cider</name>
        <notes>This is a cider style in which the juice is concentrated before fermentation either by freezing fruit before pressing or freezing juice and removing water. Fermentation stops or is arrested before reaching dryness. The character differs from Applewine in that the ice cider process increases not only sugar (hence alcohol) but acidity and all fruit flavor components proportionately. No additives are permitted in this style; in particular, sweeteners may not be used to increase gravity. This style originated in Quebec in the 1990s.</notes>
        <flavor>Fruity, smooth, sweet-tart. Acidity must be enough to prevent it being cloying.</flavor>
        <appearance>Brilliant. Color is deeper than a standard cider, gold to amber.</appearance>
        <mouthfeel>Full body. May be tannic (astringent and/or bitter) but this should be slight, to moderate at most.</mouthfeel>
        <entryinstructions>Entrants  <strong>MUST</strong>  specify starting gravity, final gravity or residual sugar, and alcohol level. Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify carbonation level (3 levels).</entryinstructions>
        <varieties>Usually North American classic table fruit such as McIntosh or Cortland.</varieties>

        <name>Cider with Herbs/Spices</name>
        <notes>This is a cider with any combination of "botanicals" added. Hopped ciders are included in this category. Other examples are ciders with "apple pie" spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice), ginger, lemon grass, herbal tea blends, etc.</notes>
        <impression>Like a white wine with complex flavors. The apple character must marry with the botanicals and give a balanced result.</impression>
        <flavor>The cider character must be present and must fit with the botanicals. As with a fruit cider, it is a fault if the botanicals dominate; a judge might ask, <em>Would this be different if neutral spirits replaced the cider?</em> Oxidation of either the base cider or the additions is a fault.</flavor>
        <appearance>Clear to brilliant. Color appropriate to added botanicals.</appearance>
        <mouthfeel>Average or more. Cider may be tannic from effect of botanicals but must not be bitter from over-extraction.</mouthfeel>
        <entryinstructions>Entrants  <strong>MUST</strong> specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants  <strong>MUST</strong> specify sweetness (5 categories). Entrants  <strong>MUST</strong> specify all botanicals added. If hops are used, entrant must specify variety/varieties used.</entryinstructions>

        <name>Specialty Cider/Perry</name>
        <notes>This is an open-ended category for cider or perry with other ingredients such that it does not fit any of the categories above. This includes the use of other sweeteners. A cider with added honey may be entered here if the cider character remains dominant; otherwise it should be entered as mead in the cyser sub-category. Examples also include wood-fermented or aged ciders in which the wood/barrel character is a significant part of the overall flavor profile.</notes>
        <flavor>The cider character must always be present, and must fit with added ingredients. If a spirit barrel was used, the character of the spirit (rum, whiskey, etc.) must be no more than just recognizable; it must not be a substantial element of the flavor.</flavor>
        <appearance>Clear to brilliant. Color should be that of a standard cider unless other ingredients are expected to contribute color.</appearance>
        <mouthfeel>Average body, may show tannic (astringent) or heavy body as determined by other ingredients.</mouthfeel>
